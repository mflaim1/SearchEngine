where

purpos
In
Bailiff
of
Burford
v
Lenthal
Lord
Hardwick
suggest
that
the
jurisdict
of
the
Court
over
chariti
matter
came
from
it
jurisdict
over
trust
as
well
as
from
the
Charit
Use
Act
1601
Carn
suggest
that
as
the
Court
had
long
been
abl
to
deal
with
such
situat
the
1601
act
wa
actual
just
the
declar
of

Thi
is
illustr
by
the
Chancellor

origin
jurisdict

to

which
came
from

origin
statu
as
a

as
chariti
had

origin
enforc
by

the

Essenti
an
owner
of

could
dispos
of
it
by
grant
the
right
to
use
it
and
collect

to

not
just
by
sell
it
Thi
wa
not
valid
at
the
common
law
court
but
wa
in
the
Court
of
Chanceri
the
Lord
Chancellor
is
report
as
have
said
in
1492
where
there
is
no
remedi
at
common
law
there
may
be
good
remedi
in

as
for

by
a
feoffment
upon

the
feoffor
ha
no

by

and
so
if
the
feoffe
transfer
to
anoth
who
know
of
thi
confid
the
feoffor
by
mean
of
a
subpoena
will
have
hi
right
in
thi
Court90
After
the
reign
of
Edward
IV
if
the
charit
land
were
to
be

or

were
to
be

to
creat
the
chariti
the
Court
of

the
onli
place
thi
could
be

as
ecclesiast
and
probat
court
did
not
have
a
valid

Remediesedit
The
Court
of
Chanceri
could
grant
three
possibl
remedi
â
specif
perform
injunct
and
damag
The
remedi
of
specif
perform
is
in
contractu
matter
an
order
by
the
court
which
requir
the
parti
in
breach
of
contract
to
perform
hi
obligations92
The
valid
of
the
contract
as
a
whole
wa
not
normal
consid
onli
whether
there
wa
adequ
consider
and
if
expect
the
parti
that
breach
the
contract
to
carri
out
hi
oblig
wa
viable93
Injunct
on
the
other
hand
are
remedi
which
prevent
a
parti
from
do
someth
unlik
specif
perform
which
requir
them
to
do
something94
Until
the
Common
Law
Procedur
Act
1854
the
Court
of
Chanceri
wa
the
onli
bodi
qualifi
to
grant
injunct
and
specif
performance95
Damag
is
money
claim
in
compens
for
some
failur
by
the
other
parti
to
a
case96
It
is
commonli
believ
that
the
Court
of
Chanceri
could
not
grant
damag
until
the
Chanceri
Amend
Act
1858
which
gave
it
that
right
but
in
some
special
case
it
had
been
abl
to
provid
damag
for
over
600
year
The
idea
of
damag
wa
first
conceiv
in
English
law
dure
the
13th
centuri
when
the
Statut
of
Merton
and

Despit
what
is
normal
assum
by
academ
it
wa
not

the
common

court
that
could
grant
damag
under
these
statut
the
Exchequ
of
Plea
and
Court
of
Chanceri
both
had
the
right
to
do
so
In
Cardin
Beaufort
's
case
in
1453
for

it
is
state
that
I
shall
have
a
subpoena
against
my

and
recov
damag
for

A

For
