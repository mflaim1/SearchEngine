would

that

Watership

for

is
to

deep

in
to

of
the
book
Pleas
do
yourself
a
favor
and
do
n't
tortur
yourself
in
thi
way
Although
it
ha
all
the
characterist
of
a
great
book
a
modern
day
classic
even
and
could
be
full
of
sybol
and
ironi
I
feel
that
it
is
best
enjoy
by
take
it
for
what
it
is
A
great
stori
about
a
group
of
rabbit
's
adventur
failur
success
selfdiscoveri
and
their
long
journey
The
stori
is
set
in
the
English
countrysid
with
great
descript
of
the
surround
as
well
as
the
rabbit
and
their
lifestyl
It
is
told
from
a
rabbit
point
of
view
but
one
that
know
human
behavior
as
well
and
somehow
Adam
make
the
whole
thing
realist
The
book
is
about
a
group
of
rabbit
that
decid
to
leav
their
home
warren
after
Fiver
a
sort
of
psychic
rabbit
tell
them
that
danger
is
on
the
way
And
so
they
begin
a
voyag
that
will
chang
their
live
forev
Along
the
way
theyt
encount
an
evil
warren
crow
a
fox
river
a
rabbit
farm
and
countless
other
danger
Their
final
destin
is
a
sort
of
rabbit
heaven
a
beauti
safe
secur
piec
of
land
known
as
Watership
Down
Also
includ
in
the
book
is
a
whole
new
languag
that
Adam
somehow
bring
the
reader
to
understand
and
tale
of
how
Frith
the
sun
god
wa
so
impress
with
ElArairah
a
folk
hero
that
he
grant
him
wonder
boon
When
I
wa
first
told
of
the
book
I
thought
it
would
be
a
cute
kid
book
I
wa
complet
wrong
Thi
is
a
matur
book
that
would
probabl
be
best
suit
for
middleschool
student
through
adult
I
would
recommend
thi
book
to
anyon
that
is
n't
afraid
to
spend
a
littl
time
and
becom
fulli
engross
in
