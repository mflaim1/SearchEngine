Jame

fascin

for

the

of

He
wa
almost
past

felt
he
could
consid
an
undersea
expedit

said
he
still
had
a
mental
restless
to
live
the
life
he
had
turn
away
from
when
he
switch
from
the
scienc
to
the
art
in

So
when
an

wa
made
from

he
decid

shoot
the

itself45
and
organ
sever
dive

over

My
pitch
on
that
had
to
be
a
littl
more
detail
said
Cameron
So
I
said
'Look
we
've
got
to
do
thi
whole

where
they
're

and
they
find
the

so
we
're
go

we

either
do
them

all
that
which
will
cost

plu
30
per

and
actual
go
shoot
it

The

shot
at
the

wreck
in

twelv
time

and

spent

Descend
to

made
both
Cameron
and

want
to

level

But
there
wa

level

come
away
from

which
wa
that
it
wa
n't
just

it
wa
n't
just
a

he
said
It
wa
an
event
that
happen
to
real
peopl
who
realli
die
Work
around
the
wreck
for
so
much
time
you
get
such
a
strong
sens
of
the
profound
sad
and
injustic
of
it
and
the
messag
of

Cameron
state
You
think
'There

filmmak
who

There
may
never
be
anoth

Due
to
thi
he
felt
a
great
mantl
of
respons
to
convey
the
emot
messag
of
it
â
to
do
that
part
of
it
right
too15
After
film
the
underwat
shot
Cameron
began
write
the
screenplay45
He
want
to
honor
the
peopl
who
die
dure
the
sink
so
he
spent
six
month
research
all
of
the
Titanicâ'â
crew
and
passengers41
I
read
everyth
I
could
I
creat
an
extrem
detail
timelin
of
the
ship
's
few
day
and
a
veri
detail
timelin
of
the
last
night
of
it
life
he
said43
And
I
work
within
that
to
write
the
script
and
I
got
some
histor
expert
to
analyz
what
I
'd
written
and
comment
on
it
and
I
adjust
it43
He
paid
meticul
attent
to

even
includ
a

depict
the
Californianâ'â
role
in

demis
though
thi
wa

From
the
begin
of
the

they
had
a
veri
clear
pictur
of
what
happen
on
the

that
night
I
had
a
librari
that
fill
one
whole

of

offic
with

stuff
becaus
I
want
it
to
be
right
especi
if
we
were

to

he
said
That
set
the
bar
higher
in

â

We
want
thi
to

visual
of

moment
in

as
if
you
'd
gone
back
in

machin
and

it43
Cameron
felt
the
Titan
sink
wa
like
a
great
novel
that
realli
happen
but
that
the
event
had
becom
a
mere
moral
tale
the

would
give
audienc
the
experi

live

never

be
the
most
engag
part
of
the
stori
when
their

the
audienc
would
mourn
the

He
said
All
my
film
are
love
stori
but
in
Titan
I
final
got
the
balanc
right
It
's
not
a
disast

It
's
a
love
stori
with
a

overlay
of
real

Cameron
frame
the
romanc
with
the

Rose
to
make

palpabl

For

the

There
wa
one
crucial
histor
fact
Cameron
chose
to
omit
from
the
film
â
the
ship
that
wa
close

had
turn
off

The
stori
of
the

wa
in
there
we
even
shot
a
scene
of
them
switch
off
their
Marconi
radio
set
said
Cameron
But
I
took
it
out
It
wa
a
clean
cut
becaus
it
focus
you
back
onto
that
world
If
Titan
is
power
as
a
metaphor
as
a
microcosm
for
the
end
of
the
world
in
a
sens
then
that
world
must
be
selfcontained15

all
along
but
never

in

She
tell

After

Rose
then
goe

whereupon
the

in

In

point
the
