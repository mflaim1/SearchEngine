When

Nolan
wa
influenc
by
that
era
of
movi
where
you
had
The

1999
you
had
Dark

1998
you
had
The
Thirteenth

1999
and
to
a
certain
extent
you
had
Memento
2000
too
They
were
base
in
the
principl
that
the

around
you
might
not
be

Nolan
first
pitch
the
film
to
Warner

in

but
then
felt
that
he
need
more
experi
make
largescal

embark
on

He
soon
realiz
that
a

need
a
larg
budget
becaus
as
soon
as
you
're
talk
about

the
potenti
of

is
infinit
And
so
the
scale
of

ha
to

It
ha
to
feel
like
you
could
go
anywher
by

And
it
ha
to
work
on
a

After
make

decid
to
make
Incept

Nolan
state
that
the
key
to

wa
wonder
what
would
happen
if

Onc

did

had
with

We
did
n't
feel
that
we
were
go

be
abl
to

of
the
size

becaus
thi

that
it

test
shoot

use

found

Out

doe
not

I
think
it
's
a

to
call

2D
The

is
it
's

You
know
95

so
forth
so
the
idea
of
call

a

is
a
littl
misleading52
Nolan
did
test
convert

decid
