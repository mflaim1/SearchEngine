I
have
read
most
of
the
review
on
thi
book
and
I
am
glad
I
did
so
AFTER
read
the
book
myself
I
found
thi
book
EXTREM
interest
and
entertain
It
is
fun
to
read
a
book
that
get
the
ole
juic
flow
in
the
brain
again
Like
other
review
have
said
I
found
myself
put
down
the
book
and
run
to
the
comput
constantli
to
do
research
It
made
me
WANT
to
learn
more
about
art
Christian
histori
etc
So
what
if
a
few
of
the
fact
are
not
100
correct
I
look
up
on
the
comput
what
wa
import
to
me
and
am
enjoy
all
the
new
inform
and
theori
It
will
be
a
fun
topic
of
discuss
and
debat
with
my
friend
who
are
Christian
Buddist
Athiest
Agnost
etcIt
is
a
novel
not
a
faith
decid
textbook
If
you
do
n't
agre
with
fact
go
look
it
up
yourself
and
find
what
YOU
think
is
true
If
that
bother
you
then
go
read
in
the
nonfict
departmentDo
n't
get
me
wrong
I
am
a
Christain
and
am
veri
comfort
in
my
faith
I
think
read
The
Bibl
cover
to
cover
can
be
more
disturb
Talk
about
contradictionsTo
all
the
peopl
who
gave
it
a
one

thank
for
your

suggest
of
The
PurposeDriven

etc
I
look

to
read
those
too

I
wa
introduc
to
the
book

Dan

onli
three

have
quickli
absorb
all
four
of
hi
publish
work
It
is
easi
to
see
whi
some
are
compar
the
work
of
Dan
Brown
and
Jame
BeauSeigneur
THE
CHRIST
CLONE
TRILOG
Both
Brown
and
BeauSeigneur
deal
master
with
the
more
mysteri
featur
of
religion
polit
and
scienc
Both
bring
to
light
amaz
bit
of
inform
which
they
weav
into
the
intric
pattern
of
their
stori
Both
are
highli
imagin
and
write
with
a
ring
of
authent
that
make
for
a
compel
read
While
Brown
compress
labyrinthin
plot
into
brief
time
period
to

BeauSeigneur
trilog
is
of
epic
proport
cover
sever
decad
While
Brown
appli
the
mysteri
of
histori
to
the
drama
of
today
BeauSeigneur
use
both
histori
and
propheci
from
perhap
a
dozen
major
world
religion
to
transport
the
reader
from
the
world
of
today
to
the
veri
dawn
of
a
new
age
in
a
stori
reminisc
of
the
scope
of
Asimov
's

FOUNDATIONOn
other
differ
is
that
