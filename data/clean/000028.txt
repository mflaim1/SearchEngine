A
Brief
Histori
by

2014
If
thereâ
ani
novel
thatâ
just
made
to
have
a
beauti
cover
itâ
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
I
would
think
thi
novel
would
be
a
book
designerâ
dream
come
true
So
much
inspir
Everi
now
and
then
Iâll
take
a
look
back
at
some
book
cover
over
the
year
for
specif
novel
Weâv
done
it
withÂ
The
Great
Gatsbi
The
Grape
of
Wrath
and
The
Sound
and
the
Furi
Now
letâ
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
cover
over
the
year
I
love
thi
one
Accord
to
the
script
at
the
top
thi
is
the
cover
design
for
the
Chines
version
of
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
Simpli
beauti
These
cover
might
take
you
back
Theyâr
one
of
Houghton
Mifflinâ
design
from
the
earli
day
Love
the
color
I
have
thi
version
Itâ
actual
the
design
for
the
wraparound
of
the
littl
box
that
hold
all
three
volum
of
the
novel
Thi
draw
alon
make
me
want
to
be
an
artist
and
I
hate
draw
becaus
I
suck
at
it
Hereâ
the
requisit
movi
tiein
cover
Iâm
pretti
much
over
these
cover
I
tri
to
avoid
them
at
all
cost
At
least
thi
one
featur
Gandalf
though
Simpl
Classic
Mysteri
I
love
thi
one
Itâ
veri
similar
to
the
edit
I
own

Thi
Like
I
mention
the
cover
for
the
box
I
own
is
abov
but
thi
is
what
the
hardcov
look
like
onc

off
the
dust

Love
it
Final

featur
the
Eye
of
Sauron
Nice
cover
but
Iâm
not
crazi
about
the
design
Kind

a
littl
dizzi
A
differ
take
on
the
Eye
of
Sauron
veri
similar
to
the
edit

own
These
have
a
1960
or
1970
vibe
to
them
though
Im
not
realli
sure
when
these

Just

So
strang

have

that

have
that
advantag
