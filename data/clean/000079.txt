Annabel

the
writer

halfEnglish
halfDutch
in
her
case
I
rememb
her
featur
far
less
distinctli
today
than
I
did
a
few
year
ago
befor
I
knew
Lolita
There
are
two
kind
of
visual
memori
one
when
you
skill
recreat
an
imag
in
the
laboratori
of
your
mind
with
your
eye
open
and
then
I
see
Annabel
in
such
gener
term
as
honeycolor
skin
thin
arm
brown
bob
hair
long
lash
big
bright
mouth
and
the
other
when
you
instantli
evok
with
shut
eye
on
the
dark
innersid
of
your
eyelid
the
object
absolut
optic
replica
of
a
belov
face
a
littl
ghost
in
natur
color
and
thi
is
how
I
see
Lolita
Let
me
therefor
primli
limit
myself
in
describ
Annabel
to
say
she
wa

child
a
few

Her
parent

Annabel
and
I
talk
of

affair
She
kept
lift
hand
of
fine
sand
and
let
it
pour
through
her
finger
Our
brain

way
those
of

European
preadolesc
were

I

All
at
onc
we
were
madli
clumsili
shamelessli
agonizingli
in
love
with
each
other
hopelessli
I
should
add
becaus
that
frenzi
of
mutual
possess
might
have
been
assuag
onli
by
our
actual
imbib
and
assimil
everi
particl
of
each
other
's
soul
and
flesh
but
there
we
were
unabl
even
to
mate
as
slum
children
would
have
so
easili
found
an
opportun
to
do
After
one
wild
attempt
we
made
to
meet
at
night
in
her
garden
of
which
more
later
the
onli
privaci
we
were
allow
wa
to
be
out
of
earshot
but
not
out
of
sight
on
the
popul
part
of
the
plage
There
on
the
soft
sand
a
few
feet
away
from
our
elder
we
would
sprawl
all
morn
in
a
petrifi
paroxysm
of
desir
and
take
advantag
of
everi
bless
quirk
in
space
and
time
to
touch
each
other
her
hand
halfhidden
in
the
sand
would
creep
toward
me
it
slender

nearer
and
nearer
then
her
opalesc
knee
would
start
on
a
long

rampart
built
by
younger
children
grant
us
suffici
conceal
to
graze
each
other
's
salti

these
incomplet
contact
drove
our
healthi
and
inexperienc
young
bodi
to
such
a
state
of
exasper
that
not
even
the
cold
blue
water
under
which
we
still
claw
at
each
other
could
bring
relief
Among
some
treasur
I
lost
dure
the
wander
of
my
adult
year
there
wa
a
snapshot
taken
by
my
aunt
which
show
Annabel

parent
and
the
staid
elderli

gentleman

Dr
Cooper
who
that

summer
court

group
around
a
tabl
in
a
sidewalk
café
Annabel
did
not
come
out
well
caught
as
she
wa
in
the
act
of
bend
over
her
chocol
glacé
and
her
thin
bare
shoulder
and
the
part
in
her
hair
were
about
all
that
could
be
identifi
as
I
rememb
that
pictur
amid
the
sunni
blur
into
which
her
lost
loveli
grade
but
I
sit
somewhat
apart
from
the
rest
came
out
with
a
kind
of
dramat
conspicu

That
photograph
wa
taken
on
the
last
day
of
our
fatal
summer
and
just
a
few
minut
befor
we
made
our
second
and
final
attempt
to
thwart
fate
Under
the
flimsiest
of
pretext
thi
wa
our
veri
last
chanc
and
noth
realli
matter
we
escap
from
the
cafe
to
the
beach
and
found
a
desol
stretch
of
sand
and
there
in
the
violet
shadow
of
some
red
rock
form
a
kind
of
cave
had
a
brief
session
of
avid
caress
with
somebodi
's
lost
pair
of
sunglass
for
onli
wit
I
wa
on
my
knee

on

out

I
leaf
again
and
again
through
these
miser
memori
and
keep
ask
myself
wa
it
then
in
the
glitter
of
that
remot
summer
that
the
rift
in
my
life
began
or
wa
my
excess
desir
for
that
child
onli
the
first
evid
of
an
inher

When
I
tri
to
analyz
my
own

and
so
forth
I
surrend
to
a
sort
of
retrospect
imagin
which
feed
the
analyt
faculti
with
boundless
altern
and
which
caus
each
visual
rout
to
fork
and
refork
without
end
in
the
maddeningli
complex
prospect
of
my
past
I
am
convinc
howev
that
in
a
certain
magic
and
fate
way
Lolita
began
with
Annabel
I
also
know
that
the
shock
of
Annabel
's
death
consolid
the
frustrat
of
that
nightmar
summer
made
of
it
a
perman
obstacl
to
ani
further
romanc
throughout
the
cold
year
of
my
youth
The
spiritu
and
the

had
been
blend
in
us
with
a
perfect
that
must

strang
distinct
as
if
it
emit
a
faint
radianc
of
it

Her

whenev

the
acrid
of
some

would

the
pain
of

by
first
roughli
rub

then
my
