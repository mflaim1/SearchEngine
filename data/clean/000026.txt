It
is
all
a
game
we
play
with
Tolkien
for
he
too
took
it
much
more
serious
then
ani
other
Fantasi

Scienc
Fiction
writer
ever

He

He
told
stori
of
all

of

Ballantin
start
to
releas
edit
of
the
triliogi
with
complet
new
map
all
sign
by
some
Shelli
Shapiro
In
either
case
these
new
map
were
plaug
with
problem
from
be
too
cartooni
and
unproportin
to
have
name
of

origin
map
done
away
with
The
map
from
the
veri
begin
have
been
essenti
to
the
LoTR
book
and
have
cheap
map
made
is
annoy
beyond
belief
It
show
a
sign
of
disrespect
from
the
editor
To
me
it
say
Peopl
wo
n't
notic
anyway
Let
make
a
smaller
size
book
with
less
detail
map
and
save
some
money
If
you
truli
want
to
expieri
thi
epic
or
histori
more
accur
as
Tolkien
envis
it
not
some
editor
at
Ballantin
spend
some
extra
cash
and
either
get
a
differ
edit
or
buy
a
good
map
there
is
current
an
excel
one
made
by
Christoph
Tolkien
which
is
much
larger
and
detail
Of
cours
were
the
map
adequ
thi
edit
still
suffer
from
annoy
miscopi
and
misprint
and
so
on
Do
n't
sell
out
for
cheap
