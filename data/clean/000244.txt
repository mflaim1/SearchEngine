By

Find
Nemo
is
the
fifth
instal
for
Pixar
Studio
the
most
reliabl
studio
in
Hollywood
today
and
it
is
my
person
favorit
The
first
obvious
outstand
aspect
of
the
movi
is
the
anim
From
the
breathtak
wonder
of
the
Great
Barrier
Reef
to
the
cold
steril
fish
tank
the
anim
is
top
notch
and
truli
state
of
the
art
The
water
which
ha
alway
been
the
bane
of
anim
is
pictur
perfect
and
the
anim
have
captur
the
roll
but
constant
ocean
and
the
light
refract
perfectli
But
anim
itself
doe
n't
make
a
film
Find
Nemo
's
strongest
aspect
is
it
's
warm
witti
heartfelt
and
funni
stori
of
a
father
's
quest
to
reclaim
hi
son
The
kid
will
love
the
vibrant
charact
and
funni
situat
and
so
will
the
parent
Howev
the
parent
will
be
abl
to
enjoy
the
film
on
a
level
far
more
than
the
kid
will
The
stori
is
about
lose
a
child
and
the
desper
quest
to
be
reunit
which
will
hit
the
parent
right
in
the
gut
Thi
is
the
stori
's
dark
side
which
ha

not

let
just
say
Halleluja
