As
part
of
my
2013
pledg
I
did
go
ahead
check
anoth
mustse
of
2012
off
the
list
On
my
flight
from
Munich
back
to
Boston
it
wa
time
to
experi
the
other
superhero
movi
of
the
past
year
The
Aveng
With
a
whop
92
on
Rottentomatoescom
itÂ
did
come
with
the
baggag
of
high
expect
Dure
the
open
minut
of
The
Aveng
my
first
thought
were
pure
happi
of
see
Robin
from
HIMYMÂ
in
a
box
offic
product
My
second
thought
were
Ok
thi
might
actual
be
entertain
In
the
past
decad
the
vast
develop
in
the
area
of
CGI
ha
givenÂ
Superhero
movi
along
with
numer
other
genr
the
abil
to
mimic
the
comic
from
which
they
are
deriv
in
a
much
more
precis
and
thu
entertain
wayÂ
And
sinc
thi
movi
categori
ha
histor
shown
an
abov
averag
box
offic
perform
Paramount
even
dare
to
do
someth
no
other
studio
in
earli
2012
would
have
donego
head
to
head
against
The
Dark
Knight
Rise
And
to
my
surpris
The
Aveng
won
that
competit
at
the
box
officeNow
arguabl
The
Aveng
are
more
a
fun
superhero
movi
rather
than
a
dark
gritti
thrillerand
arguabl
The
Aveng
manag
to
achiev
that
goal
better
than
their
counterpart
Onc
the
plot
is
clear
within
the
first
15
minut
the
entertain
part
of
the
movi
get
go
with
a
fun
introduct
of
The
Aveng
with
Iron
Man
and
the
Black
Widow
be
the
most
fun
to
watch
The
rest
is
just
a
fun
CGI
spectacl
with
no
shortag
of
fun
destruct
and
a
cast
which
is
fulli
enjoy
their
missionÂ
Look
at
the
movi
as
a
whole
it
manag
to
keep
me
entertain
throughout
it
durat
which
is
not
an
easi
goal
to
achiev
for
143
min
long
movi
The
fight
scene
between
the
Aveng
themselv
are
just
a
total
hootwith
the
Hulk
lead
the
score
in
fight
entertain
and
Iron
Man
have
the
snappiest
comment
From
a
movi
market
perspect
Paramount
doe
a
great
job
of
make
the
other
brand
in
the
franchis
more
attract
to
watch
I
alreadi
put
Thor
and
Captain
America
on
my
Netflix
watchlist
for
a
day
when
I
just
want
to
enjoy
complet
brainfre
entertain
And
it
did
make
the
next
Iron
Man
3
a
bit
more
appeal
to
watch
inÂ
theatersÂ
Favorit
quot
of
the
movi
ThorW
need
a
plan
of
attack
Iron
Man
I
have
a
plan
of
attackattackÂ
Now
there
obvious
are
some
neg
as
well
and
the
biggest
problem
of
all
is
theÂ
ridiculousÂ
villan
Asid
from
the
fact
that
he
look
like
a
13
year
old
boy
with
some
whatev
super
power
Loki
could
the
name
BE
ani
wors
ha
neitherÂ
charismaÂ
nor
superhero
streed
credibilityÂ
In
real
life
onli
one
of
the
Aveng
should
be
enough
to
eat
that
guy
up
for
breakfast
Alongsid
I
felt
thatÂ
the
dramat
element
which
wa
suppos
to
give
the
Aveng
the
push
they
need
to
pull
themselv
togeth
wa
a
littl
farfetch
given
the
insignific
of
charact
they
were
about
to
go
to
battl
for
Have
said
all
that
my
assumpt
is
that
thi
movi
attempt
to
be
more
of
pure
famili
entertain
movi
address
a
wide
audienc
Given
that
premis
the
flaw
are
easi
to
forgiv
and
you
can
just
sit
back
and
enjoy
the
ride
Thi
is
your
perfect
pure
entertain
superhero
action
movi
with
the
right
balanc
between
CGI
fun
dialog
and
superhero
fight
action
Turn
off
brain
and
enjoy
