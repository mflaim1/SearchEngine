Productionedit
The
inspir
for
Nemo
sprang
from
multipl
experi
go
back
to
when
director
Andrew
Stanton
wa
a
child
when
he
love
go
to
the
dentist
to
see
the
fish
tank
assum
that
the
fish
were
from
the
ocean
and
want
to
go
home5
In
1992
shortli
after
hi
son
wa
born
he
and
hi
famili
took
a
trip
to
Six
Flag
Discoveri
Kingdom
which
wa
call
Marin
World
at
the
time
There
after
see
the
shark
tube
and
variou
exhibit
he
felt
that
the
underwat
world
could
be
done
beauti
in
comput
animation6
Later
in
1997
he
took
hi
son
for
a
walk
in
the
park
but
realiz
that
he
wa
over
protect
him
and
lost
an
opportun
to
have
a
fatherson
experi
that
day5
In
an
interview
with
Nation
Geograph
magazin
he
said
that
the
idea
for
the
charact
of
Marlin
and
Nemo
came
from
a
photograph
of
two
clownfish
peek
out
of
an
anemon
â
It
wa
so
arrest
I
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
fish
they
were
but
I
could
n't
take
my
eye
off
them
And
as
an
entertain
the
fact
that
they
were
call
clownfishâit
wa
perfect
There
's
almost
noth
more
appeal
than
these
littl
fish
that
want
to
play
peekaboo
with
you7
â
In
addit
clownfish
are
colour
but
do
not
tend
to
come
out
of
an
anemon
often
For
a
charact
who
ha
to
go
on
a
danger
journey
Stanton
felt
a
clownfish
wa
the
perfect
type
of
fish
for
the
character5
Preproduct
of
the
film
began
in
earli
1997
Stanton
began
write
the
screenplay
dure
the
postproduct
of
A
Bug

As
a
result
Find

began
product
with
a
complet
screenplay
someth
that
codirector
Lee

The

Andrew
Stanton
cowrot

direct
the

The
idea
for
the
initi
sequenc
came
from
a
stori
confer
between
Andrew
Stanton
and
Bob
Peterson
while
they
were
drive
to
record

They

The

He
