As
anoth
review
I
too
have
enjoy
the
book
and
the
DVD
immens
but
I
have
also
grown
to
realli
enjoy
audio
book
Look
for
an
audiobook
about
a
simpler
time
I
decid
to
buy
the
audio
version
of
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
But
the
first
version
I
purchas
read
by
Shelli
Frasier
just
did
n't
bring
the
book
to
life
for
me
Ms
Frasier
seem
bore
with
the
passag
describ
the
beauti
flower
or
some
other
such
delight
So
I
look
for
anoth
version
I
then
bought
the
version
read
by
Susan
O'Malley
It
wa
better
but
Ann
still
did
n't
have
the
energi
I
wa
long
for
So
I
tri
onc
more
and
purchas
thi
version
which
is
in
my
opinion
the
best
of
the
three
The
reader
seem
to
actual
enjoy
the
beauti
of
the
world
as
much
as
Ann
doe
Sometim
the
voic
sound
just
slightli
too
old
for
Ann
's
actual
age
but
the
enthusiasm
is
captur
wonder
If
you
love
listen
to
audiobook
in
the
car
to
pass
the
time
dure
long
commut
thi
is
the
version
I
would
recommend
to
all
kindr
