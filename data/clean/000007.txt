Final
Analysi
Charl
Dicken
ha
onli
written
two
work
of
histor
fiction
and
A
Tale
of

Citi
is
arguabl
one
of
the
best
though
it
ha
a
lot
less
charact
and
subplot
than
a
typic
Charl
Dicken
novel
The

use
by
Dicken
wa
veri
vari
he
use

translat
of
French
idiom

charact
who
did
not
speak
English
and
it
bought
a
veri
differ
charm
to
the
entir
novel
Then
there
is
the
humor
mani
of
Charl
Dickensâ
novel
held
humor
but
thi
book
wa
differ
as
it
contain
a
lot
less
humor
but
it
wasnât
surpris
owe
to
the
histor
context
and
focu
of
the
novel
Yet
Dicken
still
manag
to
find
the
opportun
to
make
some
veri
wri
comment
about
variou
aspect
of
that
