Luca
may
have
problem
as
a
director
and
writer
but
I
've
alway
thought
that
those
flaw
are
balanc
by
hi
great
storytel
abil
The
problem
with
The
Phantom
Menac
is
that
he
simpli
ha
no
stori
to
tell
The
film
mere
add
an
introductori
chapter
to
a
stori
that
ha
alreadi
been
told
and
stretch
it
out
into
a
twohour
movi
It
is
no
accid
that
prequel
of
thi
kind
are
rare
They
are
veri
difficult
to
make
properli
And
appar
he
's
just
not
a
sophist
enough
filmmak
to
pull
it
offFor
one
thing
thi
project
is
limit
by
the
fact
that
anyon
familiar
with
the
first
trilog
know
the
stori
's
outcom
and
it
therefor
lack
some
of
the
suspens
associ
with
a
gradual
unfold
saga
More
importantli
howev
thi
situat
leav
Luca
with
veri
littl
freedom
as
a
storytel
It
also
encourag
him
to
gloss
over
key
event
becaus
their
outcom
is
a
foregon
conclus
he
forget
to
bring
them
to
lifeFor
exampl
we
know
there
will
eventu
be
a
romanc
between
Anakin
and
Padm
So
Luca
ha
the
two
charact
meet
here
andsurpris
surprisethey
seem
to
like
each
other
Their
develop
friendship
is
n't
portray
that
clearli
and
their
motiv
for
becom
close
are
n't
explain
Becaus
Luca
fail
to
make
scene
like
these
believ
we
ca
n't
help
be
consciou
of
how
he
's
manipul
the
plot
in
hi
effort
to
connect
the
two
trilog
Anoth
good
exampl
of
thi
problem
is
Anakin
's
portray
as
a
potenti
Jedi
There
doe
n't
appear
to
be
anyth
about
thi
kid
remot
out
of
the
ordinari
even
though
the
other
charact
keep
talk
like
there
is
Our
onli
reason
for
think
he
's
special
is
that
the
plot
requir
itIf
the
stori
fail
to
be
engag
it
is
becaus
we
never
see
the
import
event
Luca
make
a
fatal
error
in
not
show
what'
happen
on
Naboo
the
small
planet
whose
captur
is
the
focu
of
the
plot
Numer
atroc
are
supposedli
be
commit
against
the
planet
's
inhabit
but
we
onli
know
about
thi
becaus
the
charact
on
screen
refer
to
the
event
usual
rather
woodenlyTh
deadpan
perform
are
a
problem
in
themselv
but
they
onli
highlight
our
lack
of
involv
in
the
stori
Think
of
Han
Solo
sweat
in
fear
then
think
of
the
emot
vacuum
pass
for
charact
in
thi
film
Whenev
ani
of
the
charact
do
express
emot
as
in
the
scene
where
Anakin
and
hi
mom
part
it
still
seem
aw
restrain
Somehow
Luca
manag
to
keep
the
emot
reaction
of
hi
charact
to
a
minimum
which
give
the
film
an
almost
mechan
feelIt
's
true
that
A
New
Hope
never
show
Alderaan
's
inhabit
but
we
still
could
feel
the
tragedi
of
the
planet
's
destruct
through
the
horrifi
reaction
of
Princess
Leia
and
Obi
Wan
Moreov
there
were
mani
other
involv
event
which
we
wit
directli
such
as
the
slay
of
rebel
at
the
begin
the
captur
and
tortur
of
the
princess
and
the
murder
of
Luke
's
foster
parent
Furthermor
the
major
plot
element
were
intrigu
in
and
of
themselv
They
weren't
there
mere
to
show
us
how
they
were
to
be
link
to
later
event
which
seem
to
be
the
case
with
the
new
filmI
suspect
that
Luca
wa
not
as
concern
in
the
first
trilog
with
what
had
to
happen
later
in
the
stori
and
wa
therefor
abl
to
focu
hi
attent
on
the
event
at
hand
The
weakest
segment
wa
Return
of
the
Jedi
which
had
the
task
of
bring
the
stori
to
an
end
Onli
then
did
Luca
start
to
show
sign
of
forc
plot
point
In
The
Phantom
Menac
he
get
so
bog
down
in
the
task
of
bring
hi
stori
from
point
A
to
point
B
that
he
end
up
with
onli
the
bare
bone
of
a
plot
and
none
of
it
come
aliveThi
is
especi
true
of
the
character
In
the
old
trilog
charact
like
Yoda
and
Han
reveal
distinct
person
in
their
first
few
minut
on
screen
Thi
film
goe
for
more
than
two
hour
and
the
charact
includ
the
familiar
one
come
off
vagu
and
nondescript
We
are
n't
given
much
of
a
chanc
to
experi
their
person
in
the
way
they
interact
We
must
take
Qui
Gon
's
word
for
it
when
he
describ
Obi
Wan
as
headstrong
What
's
most
odd
is
that
the
cartoon
seem
better
develop
than
the
human
The
scene
where
Qui
Gon
negoti

birdlik

asid

sequencesbut
they
ca
n't
hold
a
candl
to
the
constant
interact
throughout
the
first
trilogyOn
thing
I
can
not
do
is
accus
the
film
of
lack
creativ
The
design
of

the

Watch
the
film
is
sort
of
like
read
a
children
's
book
that
is
n't
veri
good
but
abound
with
beauti
illustr
There
is
certainli
a
wow
factor
in
the
movi
's
visual
but
the
effect
of
it
is
shortlivedI
get
irk
when
I
hear
fan
talk
as
though
the
Star
War
movi
were
never
about
anyth
beyond
special
effect
While
the
invent
visual
are
part
of
what
made
the
origin
so
revolutionari
they'r
not
what
made
the

so
fun

And
in
no

After
