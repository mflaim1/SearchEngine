At

that
he
had
been
greatli
inspir
by
Escher
's
work
when
he
and
hi
father
discov
both
the
tribar
structur
ie
the
Penros

and
the
continu
step
although
Escher
in
the
1950
had
not
yet
drawn
ani
imposs

and
wa
not
awar
of
their
exist
Roger
Penros
had
been
introduc
to
Escher
's
work
at
the
Intern
Congress
of
Mathematician
in
Amsterdam
in
1954
He
wa
absolut
spellbound
by
Escher
's
work
and
on
hi
journey
back
to
England
he
decid
to
produc
someth

They
want
to
publish
their
find
but
did
n't
know
in
what
field
the
subject
belong
Becaus
Lionel
Penros
knew
the
editor
of
British
Journal
of
Psycholog
and
convinc
him
to
publish
their
short
manuscript
the
find
wa
final
present
as
a
psycholog
subject
After
the
public
in
1958
the
Penros
sent
a
copi
of
the
articl
to
Escher
as
a
token
of
their
esteem4
While
the
Penros
credit
Escher
in
their
articl
Escher
himself
note
in
a
letter
to
hi
son
in
Januari
1960
that
he
wa
work
on
the
design
of
a
new
pictur
which
featur
a
flight
of
stair
which
onli
ever
ascend
or
descend
depend
on
how
you
saw
it
The
stair
form
a
close
circular
construct
rather
like
a
snake
bite
it
own
tail
And
yet
they
can
be
drawn
in
correct
perspect
each
step
higher
or
lower
than
the
previou
one
I
discov
the
principl
in
an
articl
which
wa
sent
to
me
and
in
which
I
myself
wa
name
as
the
maker
of
variou
'imposs
object
'
But
I
wa
not
familiar
with
the
continu
step
of
which
the
author
had
includ
a
clear
if
perfunctori
sketch
although
I
wa
employ
some
of
hi
other
examples5
Escher
wa
captiv
by
the
endless
stair
and
subsequ
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Penros
in
April
1960
A
few
month
ago
a
friend
of
mine
sent
me
a
photocopi
of
your
articl
Your
figur
3
and
4
the
'continu
flight
of
step
'
were
entir
new
to
me
and
I
wa
so
taken
by
the
idea
that
they
recent
inspir
me
to
produc
a
new
pictur
which
I
would
like
to
send
to
you
as
a
token
of
my
esteem
Should
you
have
publish
other
articl
on
imposs
object
or
relat
topic
or
should
you
know
of
ani
such
articl
I
would
be
most
grate
if
you
could
send
me
further
details5
