CS
Lewi
's

book
prefer
with
a
hefti

edit
of
Philip

's
Hi
Dark
Materi
So
much
so
that
it
's
difficult
to
establish
how
much
critic
may
actual
be
deserv
All
those
alleg
of
Christian
propaganda
aim
at
Lewi
by
Pullman
and
Michael
Moorcock
are
certainli
valid
not
that
Pullman
is
innoc
of
a
religi
agenda
himself
but
do
n't
address
the
Narnia
books'
failur
as
work
of
fantasi
By
the
way
the
movi
is
no
more
and
no
