The
book
that
made
me
a
reader
by
a
writer
whose
pure
enthusiasm
for

stori
carri
you
on

I
rememb
at
my
vast
old
age
in
7th
grade
sadli
conclud
that
I
wa
too
old
for
the
Narnia
book
now
I
had
alreadi
read
them
mani
time
Then
I
took
them
up
again
in
colleg
and
found
new
rich
I
know
I
will
never
âoutgrowâ
them
again
No
kid
who
read
thi
book
will
ever
look
at
a
closet
door
the
same
way
again

when
I
switch
from
listen
to
my
mom
read
them
aloud
to
sneak
them
off
to
my
room
to
read
ahead
I
wa
convinc
that
someday
I
would
meet
the

and
tell

that

I
would
have

down
Instead
I
wa
SOB
on

as

I
finish
it
and
read
it
again
And
again
I
donât
alway

the
oldest
most
classic
version
of
a
tale
is
the
one
that

should
keep

If

Silvey
do
you
own
your
copi
yet
when
Lewi
wa
sixteen
he
envis
a
faun
carri
an
umbrella
in
a
wood
full
of
snowÂ
Then
nine
year
later
a
lion
leapt
into
a
stori
and
Lewi
began
work
on
a
book
entitl
âThe
LionâÂ
I
wa
unawar
that
he
wa
onli
twentyf
when
he
began
the
taleÂ
Heâd
be
fiftytwo
by
the
time
it
publish
thoughÂ
Thatâ
what
we
call
in
the
busi
a
gestat
periodÂ
He
did
show
an
earli
manuscript
to
one
Roger
Lancelyn
Green
though
and
Green
help
him
get
hi
manuscript
up
to
snuffÂ
The
book
wa
origin
meant
to
stand
alon
which
is
part
of
the
reason
it
bug
me
when
publish
releas
the
book
in
the
order
of
what
happen
in
the
seri
rather
than
the
order
of
when
the
book
were
written
Of
cours
he
wa
bud
with
JRR
Tolkien
though
perhap
bud
is
not
the
term
they
might
choos
to
describ
their
friendshipÂ
Tolkien
wasnât
a
fan
of
the
seri
thoughÂ
Consid
he
wa
a
fellow
who
spent
age
construct
a
histori
and
a
bloodi
languag
for
hi
fantast
world
he
found
the
whole
Narnia
thing
a
bit
slapdash
Now
if
you
walk
into
the
book
as
a
kid
and
arenât
awar
that
youâr
face
a
great
big
gigant
Christian
allegori
you
probabl
wonât
notic
it
anywayÂ
For
adult
itâ
incred
obviousÂ
Still
as
Anita
Silvey
say
The
book
have
endur
not
becaus
of
their
philosophi
but
becaus
they
bring
to
life
a
magic
world
that
reader
want
to
enter
again
and
again
Philip
PullmanÂ
Not
a
fanÂ
In
an
interview
with
surefishcom
for
exampl
he
say
Narnia
ha
alway
seem
to
me
to
be
mark
by
a
hatr
of
the
physic
world
When
I
bring
thi
up
peopl
say
oh
no
what
nonsens
He
love
hi
beer
love
laughter
and
smoke
a
pipe
and
the
companionship
of
hi
friend
and
so
on
And
so
he
might
have
done
But
that
didnât
prevent
perhap
hi
unconsci
mind
from
say
someth
quit
differ
in
the
form
of
a
stori
I
canât
even
wade
through
the
thousand
of
scholarli
articl
on
thi
book
or
even
the
BOOK
base
on
itÂ
I
will
highlight
one
thoughÂ

2008
Littl
Brown
publish
Salon

Millerâ
titl

Book

Adventur

In
it
she
record
how
My
relationship
to
Narnia
would
turn
out
to
be
as
rocki
as
ani

affair
a
stori
of
enchant
