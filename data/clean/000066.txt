is

As

Holden
is
a
teenag
stuck
between
the
authent
of
childhood
and
the
âphoninessâ
of

Heâ
a
rebelli
kid
with
the
mouth
of
a
sailor
and
the
propens
for
drop
GD
in
everi
other
sentenc
Heâ

is
hi
younger

Phoebeâwhil
find

in
almost

encount
He
remind
me
of
the
person
who
is
quick
to
point
out
the
fault
of
other
but
never
see
anyth
wrong
with
himself
For
instanc
he

he
also
admit
to
be
a
fabul
liar
and
seem
overli

with

appear
eg
the
orang

But
thatâ
the
beauti
of
the
novel
Saling
wrote
Holdenâ
charact
in
such
a
way
that
he
is
alway
true
to
the
complex
natur
of
himselfâan
immatur
teenag
tri
to
find

in
a

both

and
figurativelyâwith
all
of

Other
Stuff
The
Mean
I
kept
wait
on
the
signific
of
the
term
âThe
Catcher
in
the
Ryeâ
Holden
explain
it
in
Chapter
22
In
short
heâd
love
to
save
kid
from
the
edg
of
a
cliff
that
is
adulthood
I
keep
pictur
all
these
littl
kid
play
some
game
in
thi
big
field
of
rye
and
allÂ
Thousand
of
littl
kid
and
nobodi
around
nobodi
big
I
mean
except
meÂ
And
Im
stand
on
the
edg
of
some
crazi
cliffÂ
What
I
have
to
do
I
have
to
catch
everybodi
if
they
start
to
go
over
the
cliff
I
mean
if
theyr
run
and
they
dont
look
where
theyr
go
I
have
to
come
out
from
somewher

That
all
I

Id
just

I
know
it

but
that

Lowlight
The
fact
that
The

He

publish
mani
short
stori
and
novella
but
he
spent
hi
last
50
year
in
near
total
seclus
from
the

question
When
you

talent
like
Saling
do
you
have

share
that
talent

All

âHolden

Final
Thought
The

I
think
the
brilliant
thing
about
it
lack
of
ani
real

is
that
one
of

the

Hello
Realli
enjoy
your
review
it
ad
some
perspect
for
me
I
am
20
and
just
finish
The
Catcher
in
the

a

of

ago
Im
current
work
through
a
list
of
my
own
of
sort
and
like
yourself
decid
I
better
read
some
classic
In
gener
I
did
not
like
The
Catcher
in
the
Rye
I
consid
Holden
to
be
tediou
and
uninterest
to
read
about
The
stori
had
no
plot
and
I
find
it
unsatisfi
how
he
came
to
no
real
revel
or
improv
in
hi
life
I
found
the
dialogu
and
the
thought
of
Holden
to
be
repetit
and
exhaust
to
read
I
understand
the
stream
of
conscious
style
and
how
one
may
argu
that
Saling
is
onli
write
it
in
the
style
of
a
teenag
That
be
that
perhap
we
lock
onto
certain
phrase
that
kill
me
phoni
etc
Still
I
found
thi
a
wholli
unsatisfi
unrelat
read
that
is
not
particularli
worthi
of
it
high
statur
in
American
Literatur
That
be
said
it
did
have
moment
of
great
clariti
and

I

dreamvis
of
be
the

I
