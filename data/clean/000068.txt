the
fact
that
we
studi
The
Catcher
In
The

when
I
wa
in
Year
9
or
Year
10
at
high
school
in
the
1970
but
not
much
els
about
the
book
apart
from
that
The
onli
clear
memori
that
I
have
from
the
book
is
where
Holden
Caulfield
wa
tri
to
break
into
a
hous
He
unrol
a
sheet
of
plastic
which
is
sticki
adhes

what
we
would
describ
today
as

He
place
it
over
a
window
complet
cover
the
window
glass

then
he
hit
the

break

window
Instead
of

thousand

most
of
the

stay
