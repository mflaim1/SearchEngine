How
to

with
the
unexpect
Becaus
sometim

road
are
just
what
you
need
Im
just
as
ambiti
as

Onli
Ive
chang

Now
there

I
dont

but
Im
go
to
believ

Butâallow
me
to
retrac
my
step
to
the
moment
I
start
read
thi
book
Becaus
my
first
impress
wa
not
one
of
enthusiasm
As
an
adult
read
from
a
modern
perspect
in
thi
distant
21st
centuri
there
wa
a
bit
of
cultur
shock
and
discomfort
Allow
me
to
remind
you
that
Marilla
and
Andrew
want
an
orphan
kid
not
out
of
kind
but
becaus
they
want
a
child
worker
Ye
they
sent
for
a
boy
of
11
ELEVEN
so
that
the
boy
could
work
in
return
of
room
and
board
Let
that
sink
in

is
a
bit
of
xenophobia
and
surpriserac

It
is
possibl

You
know
how
some
day
noth
can
move
you
You
could
read
Beth
death
scene
in
Littl
Women
and
never
flinch
But
other
day
even
a
pictur
on
the
wall
can
bring
tear
Today
is
one
of
those
other
day
My
mom
made
me
read
Ann
when
I
wa
a
kid
She
wa
Canadian
and
I
think
consid
Ann
somewhat
of
a
nation
treasur
I
like
the
book
when
I
wa
eight
love
it
when
I
wa
ten
and
had
read
the
whole
seri
multipl
time
befor
I
finish
high
school
And
that
wa
befor
I
saw
the
movi
Which
as
you
said
wa
one
of
those
rare
awesom
movi
that
perfectli
captur
and
enrich
a
book
without
lose
the
charact
of
the
book
All
of
which
be
said
your
quot
from
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
brought
tear
to
my
eye
Thank
Ive
been
on
a
bit
of
a
book
stall

my
attent
and
I
need
to

love
the
first
book
of
the
seri
to
continu
on
with
it
there
are
a
coupl
of
less
than
stellar
instal
along
the
way
but

is
alway

So
Ive
never
read
thi
book
but
I
am
a
huge
fan
of
the
1979
anim
seri
base
on
it
call
Akag
no
Ann
which
is
appar
somewhat
highli
regard
in
Japan
the
founder
of
Studio
Ghibli
work
on
it
I
wasnt
sure
how
faith
it
wa
to
the
sourc
materi
I
know
a
lot
wa
ad
to
fill
out
a
50episod
run
but
read
thi
post
Im
recogn
all
of
the
scene
discuss
and
even
a
lot
of
the
dialogu
seem
to
be
ident
I
dont
think
the
seri
wa
ever
offici
releas
in
English
appar
it
wa
fairli
big
in
nonanglophon
Europ
but
if
you
dont
mind
resort
to
fansub
there
are
way
to
track
it
down
It
obvious
date
the
anim
can
be
fairli
janki
at
time
and
it
extrem
slow
pace
but
it
got
some
gorgeou
background
art
and
a
beauti
score
Ive
kind
of
fallen
in
love
with
it
âNoâ
Ann
drew
a
long
breath
âI
thought
you
LIKE
me
of
cours
but
I
never
hope
you
LOVE
me
I
rememb
watch
thi
scene
and
think
you
could
easili
interpret
Ann
relationship
with
Dianna
as
be
romant
in
the
modern
sens
without
realli
chang
anyth
Then
again
mayb
I
just
prefer
ship
those
two
becaus
Ive
alway
dislik
where
Ann

Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
thi
wa
SO
much
fun
to
read
Ive
been
wait
to
see
how
you
like
it
Ana
I
encount
thi
book
a
veri
veri
veri
veri
old
copi
of
it
when
I
wa
nine
and
help
a
teacher
clean
out
her
classroom
book
she
said
I
could
have
it
and
I
hid
it
under
my
Tshirt
bulki
old
hardback
that
it
wa
and
squirrel
it
away
in
my
room
and
read
it
And
then
reread
it
And
reread
it
again
and
again
and
again
Becaus
our
famili
didnt
have
money
for
book
that
werent
religi
book
and
becaus
even
my
librari
book
had
to
be
nonfict
and
ye
my
parent
check
I
didnt
know
until
I
left
home
that
there
were
other
book
in
thi
seri
I
wrote
SO
MUCH
fanfict
on
thi
seri
it
not
funni
Im
go
to
go
ahead
and
admit
that
her
sequel
are
probabl
better
than
mine
It
funni
to
think
with
horror
of
the
xenophob
stuff
I
rememb
it
but
it
wa
par
for
the
cours
for
Marilla
so
I
overlook
it
Now

Ooohh
thi
wa
such
a
fun
post
to
read
and
now
Im
long
to
reread
Ann
and
rewatch
the
TV
miniseri
I
actual
watch
the
miniseri
multipl
time
befor
ever
read
the
book
I
know
what
a
travesti
and
complet
fell
in
love
with
Ann
and
her
famili
and
friend
When
I
did
read
the
book
for
some
reason
I
prefer
Emili
of
New
Moon
to
Ann
But
she
is
such
a
real
love
enchant
charact
that
I
may
just
have
to
return
to
her
As
a
side
note
the
imag
you
includ
of
Ann
and
her
puf
sleev
just
about

me
die
laugh

reread
thi

Id
have
to
say

And
Ann
brought
me
to
Emili

To

less
saccharin
Ann
can
be
just
a
tad
insuffer
cheer
and
therefor
more
human
When

hold
my
head
high
even
when
I
want
to
run
how
to
be
grace
in
defeat
and
graciou
in

And
that
red
