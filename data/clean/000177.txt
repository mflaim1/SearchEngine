I
'm
in
the
minor
on
the
new
trilog
but
I
enjoy
them
greatli
They
never
quit
reach
the
height
of
the
onetwo
punch
of
A
New
Hope
and
The
Empir
Strike
Back
but
they
are
on
par
and
sometim
better
than
Return
of
the
Jedi
The
Phantom
Menac
ha
a
few
problem
but
it
is
great
entertain
The
special
effect
final
are
up
to
the
standard
Georg
Luca
envis
for
hi
stori
and
they
look
light
year
ahead
of
the
origin
trilog
They
still
hold
up
well
today
The
ad
charact
to
the
mytholog
are
great
and
the
actorsactress
portray
them
are
even
better
than
the
origin
which
wa
not
a
master
class
in
act
but
they
did
their
job
well
enough
I
especi
love
Darth
Maul
who
give
the
sith
anoth
great
villain
in
the
seri
Obvious
a
big
deal
is
made
about
how
annoy
Jar
Jar
Bink
is
and
while
I
wo
n't
say
he
is
n't
annoy
becaus
he
certainli
is
I
do
think
that
entir
thing
is
overblown
way
out
of
proport
He
doe
n't
destroy
the
film
by
ani
mean
The
stori
meander
for
awhil
and
is
probabl
the
weakest
of
them
all
but
there
's
still
plenti
of
incred
action
and
set
piec
to
hold
on
to
The
final
with
Darth
Maul
is
just
as
rous
as
anyth
in

the
music
is
superb
