and
the

monk
would
be
to
repeat
everi
day
with
chant
humil
the
one
neverchang
event
whose
incontrovert
truth
can
be
assert
But
we
see
now
through
a
glass
darkli
and
the
truth
befor
it
is
reveal
to
all
face
to
face
we
see
in
fragment
ala
how
illeg
in
the
error
of
the

so
we
must

Name
of

is
an
intimid
book
to
review
Not

becaus
of
it

which
is
consider
but
becaus
of
it
theme
the
valu
of
the
written
word
and
it
abil
to
translat
knowledg
and
wisdom
It
pose
tough
question
about
what
we
seek
in
book
and
what
they
offer
to
us
and
in
that
sens
becom
about
itself
make
ani
review
