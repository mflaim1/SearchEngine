Appreci
your
discuss
on
The
Aveng
I
particularli
enjoy
the
disagr
you
had
it
almost
got
person
As
a
rule
I
had
avoid
superhero
movi
when
thi
genr
first
got
roll
SpiderMan
Fantast
Four
Daredevil
but
have
realli
appreci
the
Marvel
film
onc
Marvel
start
take
ownership
of
them
I
love
particularli
the
fact
that
they
are
all
in
the
same
univers
Sacrilegi
Statement
Alert
Im
not
a
fan
of
Nolan
Dark
Knight
Trilog
I
felt
the
film
were
selfimport
ponder
and
preachi
These
marvel
film
especi
those
lead
up
to
the
Aveng
did
a
wonder
job
of
captur
the
fun
of
the
comic
while
offer
more
depth
and
better
stori
tell
than
the
earlier
movi
