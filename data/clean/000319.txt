IV
is
a
petri
dish
overflow
with
stem
cell
The
debut
wa
darker
and
moodier
II
wa
heavier
and
III
wa
prettier
but
the
fourth
album
is
a
triumph
of
form
meet
function
Stairway

Heaven
is
so
ubiquit
that
it
cycl
through
phase
of
deep
rever
and
selfparodi
and
the
movement
between
these
two
pole
is
so
rapid
it
all
becom
a
blur
Thi
happen
both
for
individu
listenersÂ
I
'm
go
to
guess
the
veri
young
still
discov
thi
song
and
have
their
idea
of
what
a
rock
song
can
be
expand
consider
and
on
the
level
of
mass
cultur
It
's
both
a
marker
of
religion
and
an
instant
punchlin
a
singular
that
suck
in
a
world
of
experi
and
observ
and
jeer
laughter
and
sincer
tear
and
compact
it
all
into
an
infinit
dens
point
Like
mani
who
both
love
it
and
hate
it
I
pretti
much
never
need
to
hear
it
again
But
Stairway
asid
IV
is
their
least
weird
album
It
's
basic
their
stab
at
perfect
and
they
get
there
but
thi
band
wa
alway
at
it
most
interest
at
the
margin
when
they
had
the
possibl
of
failur

Biggest

Later
that

would
put
out

a
period
of
drift
they
would
n't
return
from

wa
clear
with
the
'60

take
the
most
power

are

is

someth
admir
about

all
these

to
have
been
creat
while
the
album
wa
be
mix
and
there
is
no
reason
to
doubt
that
but
the
truth
is
Page
could
just
as
easili
make
an
altern
mix
of
ani
one
of
these
song
thi
morn
and
no
one
would
know
the
differ
The
fact
that
a
mandolin
wa
briefli
consid
to
be
slightli
louder
for
a

is
basic
a
stray
fact
and
noth

it
provid
is
a
chanc

the

they
made
when
they
were
at

creativ
peak
and
had
a
million
idea
but
were
also
under
a
tremend
amount
of
strain
and
saw
the
end
start
to
come
into
focu
It
's
also
to
my
ear
their
best

even
if
it
's
not
as
unifi
or
complet
as
some
of
what

and
in

The
best
of
the
new

still

much
for

so
they
went
back
to
