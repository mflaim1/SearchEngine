itâ
necessari
to
step
back
in
time
to
2008
Five

Marvel
execut
develop
a
comprehens
plan
involv
four
superhero
to
culmin
with
one
âuberâ
movi
say
Marvelâ
Paul
Gitter
âWe
took
the
superhero
â
Iron
Man
Captain
America
Thor
and
Hulk
â
that
we
felt
were
the
most
relat
relev
and
aspir
to
build
into
one
packag
Everi
Marvel
movi
sinc
2008
wa
creat
with
the
full
intent
of
thi
super
franchiseâ
Yet
promot
a
movi
with
four
spotlighthog
superhero
is
not
without
it
challeng
âItâ
definit
a
complex
brandâ
say
Marvelâ
Paul
Gitter
âInstead
of
just
one
you
have
four
ingredi
Iron
Man
Hulk
Captain
America
Thor
to
brand
merchandis
and
get
SKU
at
retailâ
As
a
result
The
Aveng
emphas
the
âCore
Fourâ
rather
than
ani
one
specif
superhero
in
TV
and
print
advertis
And
thereâ
a
concentr
focu
to
showcas
all
member
equal
on
Aveng
merchandis
Marvel
is
also
releas
individu
charact
merchandis
in
âwavesâ
to
help
ensur
superhero
receiv
their
turn
in
the
spotlight
For
exampl
the
first
wave
of
The
Aveng
toy
by
Hasbro
which
hold
the
toy
licens
for
the
properti
is
heavi
on
Iron
Man
and
Captain
America
The
second
wave
will
see
an
increas
in
toy
for
Thor
and
the
villain
Loki
while
the
third
wave
will
emphas
the
least
known
charact
Hawkey
and
Black
Widow
say
Hasbroâ
Daniel
Benkwitt
Retail
will
also
receiv
âsurpriseâ
box
of
Aveng
toy
in
which
the
charact
SKU
are
just
randomli
thrown
togeth
Nonetheless
fan
inher
prefer
certain
superhero
over
other
âItâ
just
like
you
would
think
â
Iron
Man
and
Captain
America
sell
more
than
Thorâ
say
Gitter
Howev
The
Hulk
may
soon
surpass
them
all
Marvel
execut
have
been
âpleasantli
surpris
by
the
phenomen
responseâ
to
thi
green
superhero
and
expect
thi
fan
affin
to
further
strengthen
onc
the
movi
open
âHi
sale

up
in
a
major
way
We
reposit
him
from
where
he
wa
alway
misunderstood
to
now
depict
him
in
a
more
heroic
and
aspir
mannerâ
say
Gitter
If
Hulkâ
success
turnaround
continu
Gitter
say
Marvel
âwill
spin
him
off
to
a
standalon
program
next
yearâ
presum
support
by
a
big
budget
franchis
movi
in
2015
The
entertain
studio
is
also
explor
way
to
promot
Hulk
as
a
âcorpor
iconâ
similar
to
MetLifeâ
usag
of
Peanutsâ
Snoopi
where
The
Hulkâ
imag

Marvelâ
multiyear

also
play
a
role
in

Start

Gitterâ
term
for
blockbust
movi
but
we
want
to
develop
sustain

As

of
the
brand

are

Thi
hefti

Marvel
had
to

âWe
