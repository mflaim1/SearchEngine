Let
me
prefac
thi
by
say
I
am
a
huge
Jame
Cameron
fan
I
think
Termin
is
a
masterpiec
of
scifi
and
the
singl
best
edit
film
of
all
time
Alien
is
easili
the
best
sequel
not
from
the
origin
director
and
I
person
like
it
a
lot
more
than
the
origin
Abyss
creat
an
interest
world
and
wa
rack
with
tension
Termin
2
is
an
action
tourdeforc
and
ha
what
I
believ
the
best
sound
editingdesign
of
all
time
True
Lie
is
goofi
fun
more
poignant
than
most
give
it
credit
for
with
a
boffo
end
and
final
Titan
wa
far
better
than
anyon
expect
it
to
be
and
ha
one
of
the
most
believ
romanc
in
a

then
there
wa
the

No

the
problem

It
is

Danc
