The

âI

The
argument
against
the
Catcher
conspiraci
We
conced
that
we
and
other
may
be
read
too
much
into
the
murder
that
some
connect
with
Salingerâ
classic
novel
It
could
be
argu
that
at
best
those
murder
are
onli
loos
relat
to
Catcher
for
it
wa
after
all
a
critic
acclaim
masterpiec
and
one
of
the
biggest
sell
book
of
the
20th
Centuri
Given
it
worldwid
popular
the
fact
that
the
book
wa
found
in
the
possess
of
a
few
killer
â
a
hand
at
most
â
could
just
be
pure
coincid
Today
if
some
new
Presidenti
assassin
or
serial
killer
had
a
copi
of
The
Da
Vinci
Code
or
a
Harri
Potter
book
in
their
possess
would
anyon
blink
And
even
though
religi
book
such
as
the
Bibl
the
Quran
Koran
and
the
Torah
have
inspir
innumer
assassin
madmen
and
terrorist
â
some
well
known
some
not
â
sure
that
doesnât
mean
there
are
insidi
mind
control
program
infus
in
their
write
What
about
Mark
David
Chapman
we
hear
you
ask
Ye
the
man
wa
complet
obsess
with
the
book
but
then
again
so
too
were
countless
other
normal
young
peopl
around

follow
it

Mani
comment
they
felt

if
Holden
Caulfield
wa
voic
their
own
inner
realiti
and
the
anger
and
frustrat
they
felt
in
their
own
live
And
for
those
who
are
insan
as
Chapman
appear
to
end
up
a
work
as
brilliantli
and
intens
written
as
Salingerâ
novel
wa
bound
to

there

Itâ

certainli

With

you

thi

As

The

ha
alreadi

the
gener
consensu
by

is
that
it
is
a
mere
coincid
that
these
crimin
commit
such
horrif
crime
after

But
how

Weâr

itâ
a
fact
that

who

have

Perhap

a

We

definit
a
mind

mechan

those

But
at
