What
set
the
book
apart
from
most
children
literatur
is
it
length
in
paperback
it
is
474
page
and
it
prose
which
while
simpl
and
unadorn
is
exquisit
render
full
of
rich
descript
and
passag
of

brutal
The
stori

Great
review
I
have
not
read
the
book
or
watch
the

if
I
may
make
a
suggest
for
you
to
check
out
the
band
Fall
of
Efrafra
They
base
their
whole
band
around
thi
book
and
it
idea
Vegan
atheist
and
anarchist
postpunkneocrust
I
guess
My
favorit
of
all
time
