The
Evolut
of
Elvi
Presley
's
Sound
Some
critic
have
claim
that
the
qualiti
of
Elvi
'
music
began
to
deterior
at
RCA
They
blame
the
declin
on

at
RCA
compar
to
the
makeshift
downhom

to
follow
in
the
footstep
of
Dean
Martin
Elvi
'
music
did
undergo
some
chang
onc
he
move
to
RCA
but
the
word
declin
is
too
harsh
to
use
to
describ
the
modif
of
hi
sound
Elvi
'
music
did
not
declin
at
RCA
but
it
did
move
away
from
rockabilli
to
more
mainstream
rock
'n
'
roll
By
the
1960
it
would
mellow
into
a
bona

The
