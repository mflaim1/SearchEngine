If

I
have
a
difficult

write

about

I
ador

when

I

I
frequent
hug
A

write

it
intrigu
some
of

just
enough
to

oversimplifi
the
caus

spirit
of
a

and
help

that
the
charact
of
Roger
Cli

John
Barsad
get
a
bit
messi
and
may
have
work
better
as

Perhap
the

But
realli
I
read
A

problem
I

with

with
except

The

which
I

is
that
the

I

The

at

that
's
what
I
found
the
most

I
could

I
wa

I
am
pleas

what
thi

come
down

There

There
is
an
understand
that

that

are
foment

Crush

it

Sow

That

the

it
so
muchSometh
els
to
be
said
is
the
rel
absenc

is
common
in
Dicken
with

except

Jerri

advanc

what

But
I

he

leav
her
with

stand

her

he

and

Perhap
my
take
wa
base
more
on
someth
I
felt
wa
implicit
in
your
review
rather
than
explicit
The
fact
is
the
locu
of
power
in
the
ManetteDarnay
famili
lie
firmli
within
the
father
's
grasp
Although
he
doe
n't

thi
power
from

perspect
I
'm
not
a
Marxist
per
se
but
I
find
Marxist
analysi
particularli
relev
to
thi
book
thi
ManetteDarnay
patriarchi
wa
a
firmli
entrench
aspect
of
the
class
system
that
the
leader
of
the
French
Revolut
were
tri
to
overturn
becaus
let
's
face
it
when
there
is
such
an
imbal
of
power
in
ani
relationship
in
most
case
that
power
will
be
abus
whether
on
the
scale
of
famili
or
nationI
think
your
notion
of
the
Suburban
is
realli
interest
too
Becaus
ultim
from
a
Marxist
perspect
the
idea
of
thi
Suburban
pictur
perfect
famili
is
a
bourgeoi
patriarchi
The
primari
purpos
of
the
suburban
famili
unit
is
to
commun
and
perpetu
oneâ
own
class
statu
You
canât
afford
to
live
in
the
suburb
unless
you
have
money
The
âpictur
perfectâ
famili
is
the
faÃad
all
suburbanit
must
hide
behind
so
as
to
not
endang
their
class
posit
If
your
neighbor
knew
you
were
beat
your
kid
and
wife
they
would
probabl
find
you
too
distast
to
live
next
to
Your
cowork
ha
those
pictur
of
hi
famili
so
that
peopl
will
think
heâ
a
good
guy
He
may
be
one
or
he
may
not
be
but
the
pictur
are
there
to
protect
hi
imag
so
hi
sourc
of
incom
and
bourgeoi
comfort
will
not
be

You

do
not
gener
have

I
think
Donalbain
that
âthough
all

foul
would
wear
the
brow
of

Yet
grace
must
still
look
soâ
I
think
in
the
case
of

Dicken
want
us
to
believ
they
are
one
of
the
few
peopl
who
not

have

almost
as

I
use
thi
term
loos
becaus
it
seem
so
derogatori
but
in
the
way
that
you
never
quit
know
what
to

The
stori
might
at

seem
straightforward
and
the

simpl

then
when

it
new

suppos
to
be
about
the
French
Revolut
But
just
when
I
wa
get
exasper
with
the
stori
line
it
explod
into
so
much
more
The
theme
of
the
human
condit
Dicken
expound
upon
are
vast
From
love
to
bitter
from
reveng
to
heroism
from
sacrific
to
friendship
and
back
to
love
again
he
touch
upon
them
all
Of
the
mani
theme
thi
novel
touch
I
think
my
favorit
is
that
of
imprison
There
are
the
obviou
charact
such
as
Manett
and
Darnay
which
are
actual
sent
to
jail
but
then
there
are
other
that
are
imprison
by
other
thing
in
their
life
Lorri
seem
unnatur
tie
to
Tellson
's
bank
Darnay
is
tri
to
escap
hi
past
and
of
cours
Carton
who
is
trap
by
hi
restless
Thi
struggl
of
man
vers
natur
is
also
seen
in
echo
of
other
scene
such
as
Manett
's
attempt
with
let
go
of
hi
time
in
prison
as
he
make
hi
shoe
the
memori
of
hi
time
there
still
tortur
him
and
Luci
's
habit
of
sit
in
her
parlor
as
she
hear
the
echo
of
the
footstep
in
the
street
bring
a
forebod
of
what
's
yet
to
come
combin
with
the
mingl
of
her
person
battl
and
the
polit
conflict
of
the
age
Thi
theme
is
a
person
one
for
me
becaus
of
event
I
've
endur
dure
my
life
as
well
as
how
much
easier
I
can
relat
to
a
charact
becaus
of
it
I
ca
n't
speak
to
them
all
becaus
I
'd
be
write
a
book
but
thi
stori
cover
almost
all
of
the
major
theme
in
literatur
Man
struggl
against
natur
overcom
advers
death
be
part
of
the
life
cycl
and
of
cours
sacrific
are
just
some
of
them
I
also
love
learn
new
word
and
Dicken
never
fail
to
disappoint
me
there
Prevar
and
tergivers
were
two
of
my
favorit
The
onli
fault
that
I
could
see
with
thi
book
were
two
Dicken
's
loquaci
and
hi
predilect
for
flat
femal
lead
I
've
alreadi
discuss
my
love
of
hi
verbos
so
those
peopl
out
there
who
want
shorter
book
well
go
read
the
Twilight
Saga
And
as
for
hi
insipid
femal
charact
well
these
innocu
be
are
more
than
forgiven
when
take
into
consider
hi
resplend
femal
charact
that
come
along
everi
onc
in
a
while
such
as
Madam
Defarg
in
Tale
of
Two
Citi
or
Miss
Havisham
in
Great
Expect
So
overal
I
truli
enjoy
read
thi
book
even
though
I
wa
impati
to
see
the
action
start
a
littl
quicker
But
hi
write
is
so
eloqu
I
soon
forgot
my
misgiv
and
got
lost
in
thi
novel
Dicken
is
a
brilliant
writer
One
of
my
favorit
and
so
differ
than
anyth
I
've
ever
read
I
like
him
better
than
Austen
or
Shakespear
or
ani
other
classicist
I
've
read
thu
far
I
'm
so
reliev
that
he
wrote
so
mani
book
that
I
can
continu
to
enjoy
him
for
a
veri
long
time
I
highli
recommend
thi
book
and
leav
you
with
anoth
passag
that
touch
me
For
the
first
time
the
Doctor
felt
now
that
hi
suffer
wa
strength
and
power
For
the
first
time
he
felt
that
in
that
sharp
fire
he
had
slowli
forg
the
iron
which
could
break
the
prison
door
of
hi
daughter
's
husband
and
deliv
him
And
yet
anoth
beauti
passag
I
leav
you
with
Physic

in
the
vice
and
neglect
of
men
will
seiz

born
of
unspeak

see
that
it

to

do

There
's
a
reason
that
Charl
Dicken

one
of
the
most
popular
storytel
and
thi
particular
novel
is
world
's

work
of

At

Dicken
's
prose
eman
pure
beauti
that
's
so
miss
in
most
of
contemporari
work
While
I
enjoy
read
literatur
that
deal
with
the
ambigu
and
uncertain
of
contemporari
life
and
the
human
natur
I
also
enjoy
read
work
that
begin

with

clearli
and
with

And
what
a
begin

what

I
dare
to

that
both
the

of

I
've
ever
read

multipl
social

and
polit
affili
and
effortlessli
weav

But
the
real
topic
of
thi

is
love
the
power
of
love
make
us
human
but
it
also
give
us
power
to
do
thing
that
we

I

two
paragraph
almost

me
to

It
is
nice
to
see
an
author
grab
hi
reader
without
immedi
resort
to
some
explos
of
violenc
I
wish
more

today
could
do
that
Dicken
use
thi
compar
and
contrast
to
set
a
tone
and
place
the
reader
into
a
mindset
to
appreci
hi
stori
I
am
mind
that
thi
book
wa
written
onli
60
or
so
year
after
the
terribl
event
of
Pari
in
the
earli
1790
It
wa
the
best
of
time
There
wa
so
much
chang
and
much
of
it
for
the
better
but
it
wa
also
the
worst
of
time
the
social
upheav
the
innoc
murder
wholesal
The
end
wa
magnific
as
well
The
tension
of
the
trial
wa
pain
and
the
wicked
of
Madam
DeFarg
resolv
itself
with

The
frustrat

overshadow
between
endless

becam
lost
