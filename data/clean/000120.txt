includ
Russia
China

and
even

In

even
some

So
whi

In

the

Appar
thi

is
enough
for

to
decid
that
Winni

In

if

youll
find

The
chief

While
those

might
find

The
book

Watership
Down
Richard
Adam
Watership
Down
is
sort
of
like
a
rabbiti
version
of
Lord
of
the
Ring
The
plot
is
epic
and
fill
with
trial
and
tribul
and
it
featur
a
larg
parti
of
rabbit
of
differ
skill
and
attribut
These
rabbit
sought
a
new
home
and
they
had
to
fight
to
get
there
everi
step
of
the
way
In
fact
the
conflict
and
brutal
realism
of
Watership
Down
is
one
of
the
factor
that
have
caus
thi
classic
to
be
ban
time
and
time
again
Though
never
ban
nation
to
my
knowledg
select
school
in
the
US
have
been
known
to
ban
thi
book
New
York
is
one
state
that
is
home
to
school
enforc
such
a
ban
though
the
phenomenon
doesnt
appear
to
be
too
widespread
Whatev
the
case
thi
epic
tale
seem
to
either
terrifi
or
inspir
peopl
so
what
the
outlook
for
thi
timeless
classic
If
you
ask
Fiver
the
oracular
rabbit
of

I
think
hed
say
that
Watership

will
be
