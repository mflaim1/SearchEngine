Thi
is
just
a
note
to
say
bewar
of
the
new
translat
if
you
've
previous
read

enjoy
the
Katherin
Wood
version
Mr
Howard
make
the
argument
in
hi
translat
's
note
that
the
languag
ha
chang
sinc
the
1940
's
and
that
a
new
translat
is
need
I
could
n't
disagre
more
And
I
do

experi
on
thi
subject
I
read
thi
titl
at

in

The

is
in

which
mostli
succe
at
remov
the
poetri
that

I

It

I
find
the
argument
for

indefencibleThre

is
not
a
review
of

of
the

Thi

you
might

it
make
me
cri
in

good
way
we
all
those
who
cherish
thi
book
love

muchHowev
the

and
get

It
somehow
manag
with

except
to
miss
the
charm
of
the

at

step
The
origin
English
translat
by
Katherin
Wood
is
a
classic
and
Harcourt
's
attempt
to
improv
it
seem
illinform
and
gratuit
to
me
I
see
from
a
number
of
other
review
that
I
'm
not
the
onli
one
who
feel
thi
way
so
I
hope
that
Harcourt
come
to
their
sens
and
goe
back
to
the
origin
befor
it
's
too
late
I
'd
hate
to
think
that
futur
gener
will
know
thi
book
onli
by
it
new
translat
and
will
never
know
how
exquisit
it
wa
befor
thatIf
you
've
never
read
thi
book
or
are
go
to
buy
a

pleas
get
an
old
one
Wood
translat
so
as
to
maxim
your
enjoy
while
at
the
same
time
foil
Harcourt

dastardli
plot
