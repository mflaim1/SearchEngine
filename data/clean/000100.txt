After

we
are
thrill
to
announc

Rose
Book
Cover
Contest
Turnout
wa
remark
and
we
most
sincer
thank
all
of
those
who
particip
and
whose
design
made
thi
contest
such
a
pleasur
In
all

35
submiss
follow
by
the
US
with
30
and
the
UK
with
25
You
can
see
the
breakdown
here
Â
The
fact
that
the
overal
qualiti
of
the
cover
wa
so
high
made
judg
extrem
difficult
to
say
the
least
and
so
we
must
again
stress
that
there
is
a
degre
of
arbitrari
inher
in
select
a
singl
winner
from
among
so
mani
excel
submiss
The
divers
wa
extraordinari
and
it
wa
wonder
to
see
such
a
wealth
of
idea
express
so
brilliantli
If
it
were
possibl
we
would
have
award
a
halfdozen
or
more
first
prize
As
it
wa
it
wa
an
excruci
process
wherein
we
first
select
our
top
fifti
choic
which
we
then
painstakingli
narrow
down
to
fifteen
then
five
and
final
to
one
So
without
further
ado
weâd
like
to
congratul
our
winner
