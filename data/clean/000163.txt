It
is
pretti
easi
nowaday
to
write
a
review
of
a
Pixar
movi
Â
Simpli
write
Great
and
end
it
thereand
you
would
pretti
much
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
The
origin
Toy
Stori
movi
were
the
come
out
parti
for
Pixar
15
year
ago
Â
They
introduc
America
to
a
new
kind
of
animationon
that
onc
again
drew
adult
and
children
Â
And
thi
movi
as
much
as
ani
tap
into
that
Andi
the
toy
owner
is
all
grown
up
and
off
to
colleg
Â
So
the
inevit
question
Â
what
do
you
do
with
all
those
childhood
memori
Â
Well
most
of
us
throw
them
away
or
give
them
away
to
chariti
Â
It
is
part
of
move
into
adulthood
except
for
me
who
keep
on
buy
toy
for
myself
They
accident
make
their
way
to
a
day
care
center
where
they
quickli
realizethey
are
no
longer
realli
want
Their
Andi
is
gone
A
host
of
new
toy
make
appear
includ
Ken
of
Barbi
fame
and
Big
Babya
scari
look
doll
if
there
wa
ever
one
a
spawn
of
Chucki
Â
Ani
parent
who
give
a
Big
Babi
doll
to
their
child
should
be
separ
from
all
children
for
etern
Now
thi
movi
is
in
mani
way
dark
Â
It
is
not
like
the
first
two
movi
which
were
larg
fun
jaunt
through
playland
Â
There
are
seriou
issu
at
hand
here
includ
how
chang
affect
life
There
is
a
scene
a
dumpyard
that
I
dont
think
my
kid
understoodbut
it
show
you
the
wasteland
that
await
all
toy
Â
It
wa
in
it
own
way
scari
and
move
Iron
the
Toy
Stori
movi
are
the
Pixar
movi
I
least
watch
Â
Mayb
they
are
too
orient
for
kid
I
dont
know
Â
But
thi
film
is
one
that
I
realli
think
I
want
to
go
back
and
see
Thi
movi
is
gorgeou
in
3D
especi
IMAX
and
that
is
certainli
prefer
to
a
regular
theater
if
you
have
the
opportun
Â
Anim
is
ideal
for
3D
and
thi
may
be
the
best
of
the
anim
3D
film
out
there
Anoth
Pixar
movi
classicbut
is
there
ani
other
kind
