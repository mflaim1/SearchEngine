thi

in

of
the
best
way
I
can
imagin
a

record
the
entir
book
on
tape
and
for
a
coupl
month
I
play
the
tape
of
her
read
a
chapter
or
two
just
befor
I
fell
asleep
each
night
My
slow
exposur
to
the
book
under
ideal
circumst
may
have
influenc
my
percept
but
I
can
say
on
each
subsequ
reread
of
the
book
I
've
come
to
appreci
it
more
You
can
read
the
book
just
for
the
stori
appar
the
author
wrote
the
book
from
stori
he
would
tell
hi
children
and
it
still
can
easili
serv
that
purpos
But
the
rich
of
hi
charact
lead
to
mani
interest
analog
to
human
life
For
instanc
from
Hazel
you
can
learn
profound
thing
about
leadership
Throughout
the
book
you
feel
that
Hazel
is
the
naturalborn
leader
of
hi
group
of
rabbit
but
Richard
Adam
wa
veri
care
to
develop
thi
impress
through
charact
featur
rather
than
powerrel
The
contrast
is
clearli
intent
sinc
the
other
leader
of
the
book
achiev

statu
through
veri
differ
mean
Mani
peopl
think
the
book
take
a
strong
stanc
against
a
particular
kind
of
authoritarian
rule
but
it
is
import
to
recogn
the
book
give
thi
impress
not
through
structur
diatrib
or
through
argument
but
rather
it
evolv
out
of
charact
consider
and
out
of
the
stori
itself
Thi
mean
that
the
result
is
far
more

For
instanc
although

Hazel

with

Adam
quit

detail
that
make
him

the
other
rabbit
even
to
the
veri
end
A
diatrib
would
not

so
complex
Fiver

anoth
great
charact
He
add
an
element
of
magic
to
the
stori
and
it
allow
Adam
to

describ
to

About

a
point
where
I
didnât

so
there
I
wa

think
about

heck
I
might

So
I
pick
Watership

back
up
with
the
intent
of
give
it
just
a
few
more

Much

so
these

Pictur
the

that
would
probabl

thi

I
wa
not
expect
to
like
it
and
that
is
whi
I
am
so
shock
that
I
did
There
wa
a
lot
more
depth
to
thi
book
than
I
ever
expect
âMani

what
they

The

about

I
first
read
the
stori
of
Hazel
Bigwig
co
when
I
wa
twelv
and
read
it
again
and
again
mani
time
sinc
love
it
more
and
more
with
each
reread
appreci
more
and
more
each
time
how
it
seem
simplic
is
actual
made
of
layer
of
complexitySurviv
is
the
big
theme
natur
but
anoth
one
is
the
coexist
between
the
old
way
and
the
new
way
the
balanc
between
the
natur
and
the
'unnatur
'
innat
and
learn
It
's
not
just
the
rabbit
societi
that
is
plagu
by
these
choic
of
cours
On
a
superfici
read
it
would
appear
that
Adam
favor
the
former
our
rabbit
are
look
for
a
way
to
lead
the
'normal
'
natur
rabbit
life
that
sharpli
contrast
with
the
decad
Cowslip
's
warren
and
militarist
Efrafa
But
on
the
other
hand
it
's
precis
the
open
to
the
new
thing
and
experi
that
allow
Hazel
's
bunch
to
surviv
the
raft
and
the
boat
the
dig
of
burrow
the
interspeci
allianc
but
they
still
hold
on
firmli
to
their
essenti
rabbit
It
's
the
harmoni
that
Adam
is
look
for
and
I
love
itAdam
succeed
in
creat
such
vivid
and
distinct
person
for
all
of
the

the
stori

them
so

yet
unmistak

at
the

Cute

bunni
they

their
statu
as
prey
for
the
'Thousand
'
the
mani
carnivor
predat
from
cat
to
hawk
to
fox
to
human
They
are
driven
by
the
need
to
live
and
multipli
and
thrive
and
when
allow
to
do
so
they
are
fearsom
inde
just
think
of
how
rabbit
took
over
Australia
for
exampl
In
Adam
'
rendit
they
are
and
are
n't
like
us
and
it
's
both
their
similar
and
differ
from
what
we
think
as
'human
'
that
make
the
stori
unforgett
âAnim
do
n't
behav
like
men
'
he
said
'If
they
have
to
fight
they
fight
and
if
they
have
to
kill
they
kill
But
they
do
n't
sit
down
and
set
their
wit
to
work
to
devis
way
of
spoil
other
creatur
'
live
and
hurt
them
They
have
digniti
and
animalityâ
Each
rabbit
ha
a
distinct
voic
and
person
without
be
peopl
they
are
nevertheless
person
but
it
's
the
three
that
stand
out
to
me
Hazel
Bigwig
and
WoundwortHazel
the
mastermind
of
the
rabbit
adventur
is
a
natur
leader
He
is
not
the
fastest
the
smartest
or
the
strongest
but
he
ha
the
understand
of
the
strength
and
weak
of
the
ragtag
bunch
he
lead
He
genuin
care
and
hi
charisma
and
lead
by
exampl
are
quick
to
win
the
loyalti
of

parallel
between

the
legendari

They
convinc
nine
other

to
leav

Driven
by

and

they
begin
an

that
if

to

about
would
have
given

world
They
meet
other
warren
of
rabbit
with
societi
aberr
that
made
them
unpalat
for
amalgam
Given
the
way
that
Richard
Adam
portray
these
rigid
social
construct
I
came
away
with
the
feel
that
he
wa
somewhat
antigovern
He
seem
to
be
advoc
that
a
looser
structur
of

Speak
of
that
even
though
these
rabbit
did
take
on
some
human
characterist
I
never
realli
thought
of
them
as
peopl
I
wa
convinc
I
wa
read
a
book
about
rabbit
not
rabbit
with
human
face
That
to
me
is
a
major
achiev
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
earli
page
made
me
feel
like
I
wa
read
a
book
at
a
read
level
below
my
comfort
zone
Rabbit
are
rel
simpl
anim
and
Adam
adher
to
that
principl
for
most
of
the
book
Clever
wa
a
rever
trait
among
warren
coloni
and
is
reflect
in
their
stori
of
past
accomplish
by
legendari
rabbit
These
stori
pass
down
oral
from
gener
to

provid
a
collect
sourc
of
cun
skill
that
are
appli
to
situat
beyond
the
natur
experi
of
our
erstwhil
hero
It
doe
n't
take
long
for
the
all
male
coloni
to
realiz
that
if
they
want
kitten
They
must
have
DOE
They
were
in
such
a
hurri
to
escap
the
warren
that
they
forgot
to
bring
the
mystic
other
half
necessari
for
reproduct
They
came
to
the
same
conclus
that
tribal
unit
have
come
to
for
thousand
of
year
If
they
do
n't
have
someth
they
need
than
they
need
to
liber

He
is
a

The

happen
to
have
a
plethora
of

and
Hazel
and
hi

of
intrepid
bunni
believ
they
are
clever
enough
with

the

the

pride
of

all

They

There

He

for

moment
both

then
Mari
calm
down
She
can
see
a
way
out

They
take
Fluffi
's
corps
back
to
Mari
's
room
and
get
out
a
bowl
of
warm
water
shampoo
and
a
blowdrier
They
do
a
pretti
good
job
of
clean
him
up
so
he
look
more
or
less
present
Late
at
night
they
sneak
out
with
a
flashlight
and
put
him
back
in
hi
hutch
They
figur
that
with
a

At
first
he
can
hardli
speak
he
's
so
angri
and
then
he
explain
what
's
happen
They
were
just
go

he
say
and
Anna
had
gone
out
for
a
last
check
on
Fluffi
She
'd
found
him
dead
and

heartbroken
Despit
everyth
she
'd
insist
that
they
go
and
buri
him
properli
at

And
then
while

were
away
some
bastard
some

had
gone

dug
up
poor
Fluffi
and
put

How

They

The

of

the

Are

some

what

What

Peopl
have
seen
in

a
riff
on
The

an
allegori
for

at

it
is
a

about

Occasion
Adam
will
do
some
authori
intrus
and
explain
the
rabbit
habit
of
hi
protagonist
but
he
did
write
thi
book
base
on
the
stori
he
told
their
kid
and
they
probabl
ask
mani
question
concern
these
matter
as
most
kid
would
It
's
not
a

problem
at
all
and
can
actual
be

a
nice
remind
about
the

of
Watership

I
did
n't
realli
think
so
It
seem
like
it
had
been
too
easi
and
anticlimact
There
were
no
femal
charact
I
also
felt
that
the
theme
of
human
impact
be
neg
and
destruct
wa
a
littl
too
easi
novelist
now
as
then
have
their
environment
impact
as
do
we
all
It
's
easi
to
suggest
that
human
are
degrad
their
environ
harder
to
say
what
should
be
done
about
it
given
that
we
are
all
complicit
in
it
and
Adam
make
no
effort
at
all
in
that
directionLittl
did
I
suspect
that
thi
wa
just
the
preambl
to
a
tremend
adventur
in
which
thi
theme
would
be
drop
almost
entir
and
the
focu
would
shift
toward
question
of
leadership
govern
and
the
will
to
power
Or
that
the
lack
of
femal
rabbit
would
turn
out
to
be
crucial
to
what
wa
go
to
happen
nextNow
a

that

One
method
adopt
by

is
to
rememb
that
they
are
rabbit
not
just
metamorphos
human
which
one
might
think
would
be
counterproduct

turn
out

âWhi
Watership

I
wa
fill
with
joy
Thi
book
ha
been
on
my
TBR
list
for
too
long
to
think
about
and
it
ha
been
mention
more
time
by
Stephen
King
than
hi
own
book
He
constantli
make
refer
to
it
and
Iâm
alway
left
feel
like
I
am
miss
a
piec
of
the
puzzl
It
took
us
a
while
to
get
around
to
read
it
but
we
final
did
I
decid
to
listen
to
thi
on

Best
Decis
Ever
You
see
in
rabbit
lore
they
LOVE
to
tell
stori
They
sit
around
and
tell
their
best
or
most
ador
stori
to
one
anoth
in
time
of
need
What
is
it
that
they
need
Comfort
of
cours
When
they
feel
scare
nervou
tire
or
homesick
they
perk
their
ear
up
and
sit
quietli
by
as
one
of
their
own
tell
a
stori
Listen
to
Watership
Down
wa
an
experi
all
on
it
own
one
that
I
will
never
forgetLet
me
introduc
you
to
Fiver
Heâ
a
wee
littl
rabbit
who
get
overlook
in
an
overwhelm
warren
Heâ
veri
nervou
and
ha
these
premonit
that
he
can
not
control
So
one
day
he
hop
on
over
to
hi
brother
Hazel
and
tell
him
âSometh
bad
is
head
thi
way
We
must
leav
at
onceâ
There
are
rule
and
a
system
of
hierarchi
that
prevent
them
from
do
just
that
They
must
take
appropri
action
in
order
to
get
the
other
bunni
to
safeti
When
the
leader
of
the
warren
ignor
him
Hazel
and
Fiver
decid
to
warn
as
mani
of
the
other
bunni
as
they
can
so
that
they
can
band
togeth
and
head
to
safer
territori
Now
let
me
introduc
you
to
Hazel
Someon
onc
said
that
the
best
leader
are
the
one
who
donât
ask
for
it
or
even
want
it
Hazel
is
a
prime
exampl
of
that
Hazel
is
unsur
of
hi
stand
among
hi
peer
and
second
guess
himself
while
make
decis
that
he
think
will
help
hi
comrad
He
never
think
of
himself
as
their
leader
but
as
one
of
them
and
that
is
precisi
what
make
him
such
a
great
leader
and
characterI
wa
veri
nervou
about
how
the
bunni
would
surviv
onc
they
left
the
safeti
of
their
former
warren
They
were
off
on
an
adventur
where
they
knew
not
what
they
would
face
a
blind
journey
into
the
face
of
the
unknown
Iâv

read
too
mani

novel
becaus
I
found
myself

my
breath
everi
time
the

Dele

OK
I
have

it
so
that
help
It
all
start
with
a
psychic
bunni
stop
laugh
back
there
call
Fiver
who
ha
a
vagu
premonit
of
impend
death
and
destruct
come
to
hi
warren
He
convinc
hi
best
friend
Hazel
and
a
few
other
rabbit
to
leav
the
warren
for
a
safer
place
to
live
their
attempt
to
start
a
total
evacu
is
quickli
nix
by
the
Chief
Rabbit
The
first
half
of
the
book
tell
the
stori
of
the
rabbit
motley
crewâ
or
mÃtley
crÃ¼e
if
you
prefer
difficult
journey
from
their
warren
to
find
a
safe
locat
to
start
a
new
warren
The
second
half
is
about
their
defenc
of
their
new
warren
against
an
older
bigger
warren
rule
by
a
despot
dictat
call
Woundwort
who
is
someth
of
a
monstrou
mutant
mega
rabbit
Interspers
between
the
chapter
are
charm
and
wonder
folk
tale
about
the
adventur
of
a
legendari
hero
call
ElahrairahPlot
world
build
and
characteris
are
brilliantli
balanc
in
thi
book
Even
at
almost
500
page
there
is
never
a
dull
moment
Those
look
for
action
adventur
should
realli
check
out
thi
book
There
are
hair
rais
chase
scene
espionag
scene
interspeci
allianc
and
a
bloodi
fight
scene
that
should
be
read
with
Survivorâ
Eye
of
the
Tiger
play
in
the
background
On
the
characteris
side
it
is
worth
note
that
the
rabbit
in
thi
book
are
not
anthropomorph
anim
they
do
not
wear
cloth
drive
car
watch
TV
etc
Yet
there
is
also
much
human
in
their
rabbitri
they
can
be
compassion
love
kind
cruel
egotist
melancholi
etc
These
human
trait
are
believ
portray
as
rabbit
trait
through
the
incred
talent
of
Richard
Adam
The
prose
is
absolut
beauti
with
wonder
metaphor
like
âan
indestruct
flood
of
rabbitryâ
I
can
pick
a
great
passag
out
of
almost
everi
page
Here
is

exampl
Mani
human
be
say
that
they

the
winter
but
what
they
realli
enjoy
is
feel
proof

it
For
them
there
is
no
winter
food
problem
They

and

I
just
recent
got
around
to
pick
it
up
Base
on
my
memori
of
the
film
version
I
wa
expect
Game
of
Throne
with
rabbit
I
wa
expect
a
relentless
parad
of
death
and
despair
Thi
is
n't
what
I
got
Ye
thi
is
a
matur
book
and
it
is
realist
and
honest
about
the
rabbit
's
place
in
the
world
and
it
certainli
doe
n't
shi
away
from
the
realiti
of
their
place
in
the
food
chain
But
I
wa
expect
crush
tragedi
after
crush
tragedi
and
what
I
got
wa
a
much
more
balanc
depict
of
the
rabbit
's
life
I
wa
n't
disappoint
that
my
expect
did
n't
match
thi
book
's
contentsThi
wa
a
slower
read
for
me
But
thi
I
have
to
admit
can
be
at
least
in
part
attribut
to
the
circumst
surround
my
read
of
the
book
I
wa
extrem
busi
while
read
thi
and
the
onli
time
I
had
to
read
wa
just
befor
bed
The
book
did
n't
keep
me
up
I
wa
out
in
under
fifteen
minut
almost
everi
night
after
the
old
Kindl
slap
me
in
the
face
multipl
time
as
I
nod
off
But
structur
it
did
n't
feel
like
a
novel
It
felt
like
a
collect
of
interconnect
stori
or
a
fixup
until
about
the
halfway
mark
when
we
're
at
long
last
introduc
to
the
book
's
central
conflict
Anoth
aspect
of
the
book
that
slow
it
down
for
me
wa
the
stori
within
the
stori
about
rabbit
folklor
These
stori
in
themselv
I
found
entertain
but
they
did
kill
the
momentum
for
me
everi
timeOveral
I
enjoy
thi
book
a
great
deal
and
I
think
it
will
be
one
that
will
stick
in
my
memori
for
year
to
come
It
's
a
rich
book
with
a
layer
narr
There
are
beauti
passag
sprinkl
throughout
An
obviou
respect
for
natur
and
a
passion
for
natur
's
beauti
serv
as
a
nice
contrast
to
the
harrow
event
of
the
stori
The
narr
is
at
first
biblic
in
tone
then
dystopian
It
veer
suddenli
into
a
heist
stori
return
again
to

and
final
settl

of

page
I
wa
sad
when
the
stori
end
I
love
the
characteris
in
the
book
I
guess
that
in
a
stori
about
a
bunch
of
rabbit
it
could
be
easi
to
mistak
one
for
the
other
Not
in
thi
book
Each
of
the
main
rabbit
ha
a
distinct
charact
and
throughout
the
book
I
found
that
I
actual
realli
care
about
them
I
ca
n't
realli
say
much
more
about
the
charact
without
give
the
storylin
away
but
suffic
to
say
that
it
wa
a
rollercoast
of
emotionsTh
stori
carri
deeper
mean
than
just
a
stori
about
rabbit
It
's
a
tale
of
surviv
teamwork
friendship
and
persever
I
think
that
thi
messag
is
a
valid
one
for
adult
and
children
alik
and
that
at
some
point
EVERYON
should
read
thi
book

ca

venga

Il
viaggio

lunghissimo

molto
breve
Il

questo

incapperÃ

Ã
l'episodio
della
conigliera
maledetta
Questo
posto
sembra
molto
accoglient

apatici
Vivono
vicinissimi

uomini

questo

acqu

Finalment

Vengono

Tornando
alla
spedizion
per
la
grand
conigliera
che

tema
social
del
romanzo
E
spero
di
non
essermi
sbagliato
e
di
non
star
sparando
un
mare
di
stronzat
Questa
societÃ
conigliesca
Ã
retta
da
Vulneraria
e
da
una
speci
di
aristocrazia
militar
chiamata
Ausla
present
quasi
in
tutt

ma
qui
con
poteri

assoluti
Gli
orari
dei
conigli
sono
scanditi
regolarment
Nessuno

ne

andar
Chi
tenta
la
fuga
vien
o
ammazzato
o
torturato
Se
arrivano
forestieri
vanno
arrestati

in
