Product
The
inspir
for
Nemo
wa
made
up
of
multipl
experi
The
idea
goe
back
to
when
director
Andrew
Stanton
wa
a
child
when
he
love
go
to
the
dentist
to
see
the
fish
tank
assum
that
the
fish
were
from
the
ocean
and
want
to
go
home
In
1992
shortli
after
hi
son
wa
born
he
and
hi
famili
took
a
trip
to
Six
Flag
Discoveri
Kingdom
which
wa
call
Marin
World
at
the
time
There
he
saw
the
shark
tube
and
variou
exhibit
he
felt
that
the
underwat
world
could
be
done
beauti
in
comput
anim
Later
in
1997
he
took
hi
son
for
a
walk
in
the
park
but
found
that
he
wa
over
protect
him
constantli
and
lost
an
opportun
to
have
ani
fatherson
experi
on
that
day
In
an
interview
with
Nation
Geographicmagazin
he
state
that
the
idea
for
the
charact
of
Marlin
and
Nemo
came
from
a
photograph
of
two
clownfish
peek
out
of
an
anemon
It
wa
so
arrest
I
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
fish
they
were
but
I
could
n't
take
my
eye
off
them
And
as
an
entertain
the
fact
that
they
were
call
clownfishâit
wa
perfect
There
's
almost
noth
more
appeal
than
these
littl
fish
that
want
to
play
peekaboo
with
you
Also
clownfish
are
veri
color
but
do
n't
tend
to
come
out
of
an
anemon
veri
often
and
for
a
charact
who
ha
to
go
on
a
danger
journey
Stanton
felt
a
clownfish
wa
the
perfect
kind
of
fish
for
the
charact
Preproduct
of
the
film
took
place
in
earli
1997
Stanton
began
write
the
screenplay
dure
the
postproduct
of
A
Bug
's
Life
As
such
it
began
product
with
a
complet
screenplay
someth
that
codirector
Lee
Unkrich
call
veri
unusu
for
an
anim
film
The
artist
took
scuba
dive
lesson
so
they
could
go
and
studi
the
coral
reef
The
idea
for
the
initi
sequenc
came
from
a
stori
confer
between
Andrew
Stanton
and
Bob
Peterson
while
drive
to
record
the
actor
Ellen
DeGener
wa
cast
after
Stanton
wa
watch
Ellen
with
hi
wife
and
see
Ellen
chang
the
subject
five
time
befor
finish
one
sentenc
as
Stanton
recal
There
wa
a
pelican
charact
known
as
Gerald
who
in
the
final
film
end
up
swallow
and
choke
on
Marlin
and
Dori
who
wa

a
friend
of
Nigel
They
were
go
to
play
against
each
other
as
Nigel
be
neat
fastidi
while
Gerald
be
scruffi
and
sloppi
Howev
the
filmmak
could
not
find
an
appropri
scene
for
them
that
did
n't
slow
the
pace
of
the
pictur
down

turtl
Stanton
origin
did
the
voic
for
the
film
's
stori
reel
and
assum
they
would
find
an
actor
later
When
Stanton
's
perform
wa
popular
in
test
screen
Stanton
decid
to
keep
hi
perform
in
the
