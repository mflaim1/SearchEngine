If
were
lucki
Catcher
in
the
Rye
will
never
be
made
into
a
movieÂ
It
manag
to
avoid
that
fate
for
over
sixti
year
and
hope
it
will
continu
to
do
soÂ
Not
everyth
need
to
be
a
movi
and
I
say
that
as
someon
who
love
moviesÂ
We
live
in
an
age
where
someth
alway
had
to
be
translat
into
other
thing
and
whoever
own
the
right
happili
take
the
money
that
translat
providesÂ
JD
Saling
wa
not
one
of
those
peopl
and
he
never
sold
the
right
for
Catcher
in
the
RyeÂ
Produc
will
continu
to
hunger
for
the
opportun
to
turn
one
of
the
greatest
novel
of
alltim
into
someth
that
can
be
view
in
under
two
hour
but
Saling
wasnt
just
be
stodgi
when
he
refus
to
give
up
the
rightsÂ
In
a
letter
he
wrote
in
1957
he
list
hi
reason
for
whi
he
couldnt
see
Catcher
in
the
Rye
as
a
play
or
a
motion
pictureÂ
Hit
the
jump
for
hi
argument
The
letter
pop
up
onlin
about
two
year
ago
but
for
those
who
didnt
see
it
Cameron
Crow
post
a
partial
copi
on
hi
websit
yesterdayÂ
In
the
letter
Saling
list
the
follow
reason
whi
he
doesnt
think
Catcher
in
the
Rye
can
be
translat
to
the
stage
or
screen
It
a
novelist
novelÂ
Saling
talk
about
the
asid
of
Holden
thought
like
gasolin
rainbow
in
street
puddl
hi
philosophi
or
way
of
look
at
cowhid
suitcas
and
empti
toothpast
cartonsâin
a
way
hi
thought
The
immeasur
riski
busi
of
use
actorsÂ
Saling
couldnt
envis
a
child
actress
play
Phoeb
or
a
young
actor
play
Holden
becaus
even
if
they
had
X
they
wouldnt
know
what
to
do
with
it
No
director
could
get
the
necessari
perform
from
these
actor
Saling
particularli
couldnt
see
the
book
be
done
as
a
stage
play
due
to
the
medium
technic
limit
One
could
argu
that
Saling
simpli
didnt
have
the
imagin
to
consid
what
could
be
done
with
hi
novel
and
it
imposs
to
know
what
he
would
say
about
a
film
adapt
base
on
how
far
the
medium
ha
come
sinc
1957
he
die
in
2010
and
no
record
comment
on
a
Catcher
in
the
Rye
movi
ha
been
found
past
hi
letterÂ
But
those
argument
are
besid
the
pointÂ
To
be
honest
Saling
could
have
simpli
respond
Fuck
youÂ
That
whi
and
it
would
be
a
respect
answerÂ
We
can
dream
about
how
suchandsuch
would
make
a
good
movi
or
TV
show
but
the
origin
dreamer
should
alway
have
the
final
sayÂ
He
or
she
doesnt
owe
us
an
explan
but
I
commend
Saling
for
provid
hi
rational
to
someon
who
ask
for
it

I
think
most
literari
writer
have
troubl
see
their
work
adapt
into
other
medium
It
is
whi
they
wrote
novel
and
not
screenplay
or
script
Howev
with
advanc
in
the
technolog
of
filmographi
I
dont
think
that
ani
stori
can
not
be
told
in
that
medium
It
may
be
difficult
not
worth
the
troubl
or
it
may
step
outsid
the
bound
of
commonli
accept
film
techniqu
But
the
form
still
can
exist
one
could
easili
rework
Holden
Caulfield
thought
into
voiceov
or
some
other
form
though
it
might
turn
it
more
into
an
art
film
than
a
hollywood
lacklust
As

the

I
think

much
in

sinc
JD

wrote
that
letter

mani
15

Ive

with
the
right
actor
and
a
good

a
qualiti
movi
could
be
made
Is
it

Well
noth

The
question
is
doe
someon
out
there
have
the
passion
to
make

movi
for
it
artist
merit
and
have
money
be
a
standasid
becaus
if
it
just
about
capit
on
the
popular
of
the
novel
then
there
is
plenti
of
other
work
to
exploit
Osiri
I
would
use

The

is
whether

Whether
there
is

Say
no

Timm
Mr
Saling
talk
at

about
how
import
he
thought
the

and
I
dont

he
saw
it

more
time

While
I
do
believ
it
could

such

There
seem
to
be
a
misunderstand
a
few
have
comment
that
Catcher
in
the
Rye
could
be
made
into
a
featur
film
Ye
obvious
if
you
have
a
camera
anyth
can
be
made
into
a
film
it
a
question
of
the
qualiti
of
the
film
that
is
debat
I
would
argu
a
resound
NO
no
it
would
not
make
for
a
decent
film
Nor
a
decent
TV
seri
mini
seri
or
a
stage
play
Becaus
the
book
is
more
or
less
a
long
soliloquy
ye
I
rememb
he
technic
talk
to
a
psychologist
but
I
say
soliloquy
becaus
the
charact
rambl
in
great
detail
about
the
event
of
a
weekend
hi
emot
opinion
it
not
set
up
as
a
convers
and
there
arent
variou
point
of
view
The
closest
film
that
could
resembl
the
narr
style
of
Catcher
in
the
Rye
might
be
Ferri
Bueller
Day
Off
becaus
Bueller
is
reveal
what
he
think
directli
at
the
camera
at
us
and
break
off
to
talk
to
hi
friend
or
run
around
Chicago
But
Bueller
isnt
a
complex
charact
he
the
guy
have
a
good
time
Holden
Caulfield
is
a
far
more
complic
charact
On
the
flip
side
of
the
argument
would
I
want
to
read
a
novel
adapt
of
Ferri
Bueller
Day
Off
No
and
I
doubt
most
peopl
would
ask
whi
what
the
point
in
that
So
whi
would
peopl
want
to
see
a
film
adapt
of
Catcher
in
the
Rye
again
whi
and
what
the
point
in
that
