Befor
I
begin
let
me
just
inform
you
I
'm
a
guy
who
's
not
been
a
big
fan
of
Christoph
Nolan
's
Batvers
I
still
have
n't
manag
to
finish
Batman
Begin
slept
through
it
twice
the
onli
reason
I
like
The
Dark
Knight
wa
becaus
of
Heath
Ledger
's
Joker
So
the
review
that
follow
is
complet
unbias
And
ye
it
is
spoilerfre
so
you
can
gladli
proceed
if
you
have
n't
seen
the
movi
yet
Jonathan
Christoph
Nolan
have
manag
to
creat
a
stori
so
engag
that
you
actual
do
n't
miss
the
presenc
of
Joker
in
the
movi
It
doe
n't
even
give
you
time
to
think
what
the
movi
would
've
been
with
him
in
it
Christoph
's
direct
is
topnotch
as
alway
Onli
after
see
thi
movi
do
I
truli
appreci
hi
realworld
approach
to
the
entir
Batman
univers
If
it
did
n't
complet
have
me
sold
with
TDK
I
total
got
it
in
thi
one
Ye
you
feel
the
strength
of
all
the
charact
but
Nolan
's
real
gritti
style
help
you
also
see
the
more
human
side
the
vulner
of
each
of
the
charact
It
doe
n't
make
you
go
Oh
well
he
's
Batman
He
's
OBVIOUS
gon
na
save
the
day
You
truli
feel
for
the
charact
the
situat
they
are
caught
in
The
excel
edit
help
move
the
stori
swiftli
from
one
event
to
the
other
without
wast
ani
time
thu
give
you
a
veri
wellpac
movi
that
will
keep
you
engross
from
start
to
finish
It
's
good
to
see
that
equal
screen
time
ha
been
given
to
the
three
main
lead
charact
without
one
overshadow
the
other
but
rather
each
help
the
stori
's
progress
Onto
the
act
I
wont
even
bother
comment
on
Gari
Oldman
Morgan
Freeman
Michael
Cain
those
guy
are
master
Christian
Bale
as
alway
is
great
as
Bruce
Wayn
aka
the
Batman
I
think
in
thi
movi
he
get
a
lot
of
screentim
as
Bruce
that
help
him
display
hi
craft
well
The
weird
Batvoic
is
still
slightli
annoy
distract
but
by
the
third
movi
now
you
just
expect
it
it
's
automat
ignor
For
me
iron
I
wa
wait
to
see
thi
film
more
for
Bane
Hathaway
's
Catwoman
than
Batman
himself
So
let
me
get
onto
their
perform
Tom
Hardi
ha
definit
proven
hi
mettl
befor
with
Incept
Warrior
But
it
take
a
whole
new
level
of
act
to
be
abl
to
display
the
evil
wrath
intellig
power
arrog
emot
just
through
your
eye
voic
with
the
rest
of
your
face
cover
by
a
cumbersom
mask
Thi
guy
manag
it
so
well
that
he
make
it
look
easi
You
see
the
emot
in
hi
eye
you
can
feel
it
in
hi
voic
It
's
also
a
relief
to
be
actual
abl
to
understand
him
clearli
after
all
the
flak
Bane
's
voic
got
when
the
first
trailer
wa
releas
Sometim
though
hi
voic
sound
almost
unrecogniz
that
it
made
me
wonder
at
time
if
it
wa
realli
hi
Now
my
fave
part
Catwoman
Ann
Hathaway
ha
total
kill
it
She
wa
brilliant
I
knew
she
would
be
When
she
wa
first
announc
to
be
play
Catwoman
my
onli
qualm
wa
if
she
could
pull
off
the
entir
sexi
persona
But
man
she
nail
the
role
right
from
her
dialogu
deliveri
to
just
the
way
she
move
she
's
simpli
badass
She
's
all
the
thing
you
ever
want
to
see
in
Selina
Kyle
on
the
silver
screen
her
sexi
her
stealth
her
cun
the
wisecrack
I
love
that
thi
Catwoman
is
n't
an
allout
black
or
white
charact
but
grey
just
like
in
the
comic
Hathaway
constantli
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
wa
the
reason
for
my
applaus
exclaim
quit
a
few
time
in
the
movi
Till
date
Michel
Pfeiffer
's
turn
as
the
felin
foe
in
Tim
Burton
's
Batman
Return
ha
been
my
alltim
fave
Hathaway
's
perform
ha
made
me
have
Pfeiffer
share
that
spot
with
her
I
still
love
Michel
's
interpret
too
much
to
drop
her
to
second
Christoph
Nolan
recent
said
that
he
'd
definit
love
to
see
Ann
in
her
own
spinoff
Catwoman
movi
after
see
TDKR
I
total
see
whi
complet
agre
Definit
load
of
Selina
moment
in
here
The
action
is
quick
wellpac
but
not
in
a
way
that
is
tough
to
follow
The
fact
that
the
movi
is
n't
in
the
irksom
3D
is
serious
a
bless
no
blurri
action
here
It
's
good
to
see
the
differ
fight
style
of
our
three
main
charact
Oh
let
me
just
add
here
if
Catwoman
wa
one
reason
that
got
me
to
applaud
on
quit
a
few
occas
the
spectacular
Bat
aircraft
wa
the
other
it
is
just
simpli
awesom
So
if
you
have
n't
surmis
as
yet
thi
is
definit
a
mustwatch
I
give
it
a
solid
9510
It
's
a
nearperfect
mix
of
great
stori
action
drama
brilliant
act
a
dash
of
romanc
a
veri
gener
sprinkl
for
Nolan
of
laugh
here
there
I
love
how
thi
movi
conclud
thi
trilog
nice
by
tie
togeth
all
the
loos
end
with
a
beauti
end
but
ye
I
'd
love
to
see
more
though
we
know
it
ai
n't
happen
not
with
Nolan
at
least
I
hope
we
at
least
get
an
Ann
Hathaway
solo
Catwoman
spinoff
movi
Warner
Brother
make
it
happen
What
did
I
think
of
the
special
effect
costum
background
score
Also
wa
it
better
than
The
Aveng
or
not
unfair
I
know
