It
's
just
about

tri
to
come

You
've

it

the
dynam

I
think
there
's
certainli
a

kind
of
friction
between
myself
and
Toni
Stark
they
're
polar
opposit
One
guy
is
flash

and
smooth
and
the
other
guy
is
selfless
and
in

They

About
replac
Norton
Ruffalo
said
I
'm
a
friend
of
Ed
's
and
yeah
that
wa
n't
a
great
way
for
all
that
to
go
down
But
the
way
I
see
it
is
that
Ed
ha
bequeath
thi
part
to
me
I
look
at
it
as
my
gener
's
Hamlet
About
the
charact
he
said
He
's
a
guy
struggl
with
two
side
of
himselfâth
dark
and
the
lightâand
everyth
he
doe
in
hi
life
is
filter
through
issu
of
control
I
grew
up
on
the
Bill
Bixbi
TV
seri
which
I
thought
wa
a
realli
nuanc
and
real
human
way
to
look
at
the
Hulk
I
like
that
the
part
ha
those
qualities13
In
Octob
2014
Norton
claim
he
chose
never
to
play
Hulk
again
becaus
he
want
more
divers
with
hi
career
and
did
not
want
to
be
associ
with
onli
one
character14
Regard
the
Hulk
's
place
on
the
team
Ruffalo
said
He
's
like
the
teammat
none
of
them
are
sure
they
want
on
their
team
He
's
a
loos
cannon
It
's
like
'Just
throw
a
grenad
in
the
middl
of
the
group
and
let
's
hope
it
turn
out
well15
Thi

When

I
thought
that
wa
a
realli
kickass
approach
to

Then
they
told
me
about
thi
Hawkey
charact
and
I
like
how
he
wa
n't
realli
a
superhero
he
's
just
a
guy
with
a
high
skill

I
could
connect

you

is
not

he
's
the
onli
one
who
can

with

He
know

when

Tom

nemesi

on

About
hi
charact
's
evolut
from
the
film
Thor
Hiddleston
said
I
think
the
Loki
we
see
in
The
Aveng
is
further
advanc
You
have
to
ask
yourself
the
question
How
pleasant
an
experi
is
it
disappear
into
a
wormhol
that
ha
been
creat
by
some
kind
of
super
nuclear
explos
of
hi
own
make
So
I
think
by
the
time
Loki
show
up
in
The
Aveng
he
's
seen
a
few
things28
About
Loki
's
motiv
Hiddleston
said
At
the
begin
of
The
Aveng
he
come
to
Earth
to
subjug
it
and
hi
idea
is
to
rule
the
human
race
as
their
king
And
like
all
the
delusion
autocrat
of
human
histori
he
think
thi
is
a
great
idea
becaus
if
everyon
is
busi
worship
him
there
will
be
no
war
so
he
will
creat
some
kind
of
world
peac
by
rule
them
as
a
tyrant
But
he
is
also
kind
of
delud
in
the
fact
that
he
think
unlimit
power
will
give
him
selfrespect
so
I
have
n't
let
go
of
the
fact
that
he
is
still
motiv
by
thi
terribl
jealousi
and
kind
of
spiritu
desolation29

explain
that

1851
is

we
need
the

in

abl
to

in
all
the

like

and

We
had
to
give

within

Also
Joss
Whedon
knew
the
final
battl

wa
go
to

thi

in

so
the
height
and

of

important100

In

Whedon

it

hi
decis
to
includ
Thano
in
a
postcredit
scene
although
the
charact
is
not
identifi
in
the
film
He
for
me
is
the
most
power
and
fascin
Marvel
villain
He
's
the
great
grand
daddi
of
the
badass
and
he
's
in
love
with
Death
and
I
just
think
that
's
so
cute
For
me
the
greatest
Aveng
comic
book
wa
Aveng
Annual
7
1977
that
Jim
Starlin
did
follow
by
Marvel
TwoinOn
Annual
2
1977
that
contain
the
death
of
Adam
Warlock
Those
were
some
of
the
most
import
text
and
I
think
underr
mileston
in
Marvel
histori
and
Thano
is
all
over
that
so
somebodi
had
to
be
in
control
and
had
to
be
behind
Loki
's
work
and
I
wa
like
'It
's
got
to

they

the
