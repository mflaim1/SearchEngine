Throughout

we
see
Holden

pessimist
view
of

as
a
goddamn
phoni
and
seem
to
trust
no
one

exclud
hi
younger
sister
Phoeb
At
some
point
Holden
seem
like
a
child
see
the
world
and
clumsili
trip
through
it
for
the
first
time
and
other
an
old
man
view
the
sceneri
with
wise
bitter
eye
but
most
of
the
time
Holden
is
a
bratti
teenag
angri
and
mean
Holden
smoke
like
there
's
no
tomorrow
tri
to
find

anywher
he
can
get

everi
thought
back
to

although
he
is
terrifi
of

swear
to
God

is
alway
make
outburst
about

psychiatr
hospit
and
ha
been
tell
hi
stori
to
a
therapist
the
entir
novel
I
think
that
the
point
of
thi
is
to
endear
the
reader
to
Holden
but
in
all
honesti
he
's
spent
the
entir
novel
bitch
and
I
ca
n't
find
it
in
my
heart
to
feel
veri
badli
for
him
Holden
claim
that
societi
ha
the
problem
that
societi
is
out
to
get
him
that
societi
is
phoni
and
yet
Holden
is
the
phoniest
of
all
he
's
a
notori
liar
constantli
give
fake

stori
Holden
Caulfield
may
be
the
biggest
oxymoron
of
a
charact
that
I
've
ever
seen
in
a

I
'll
probabl
get
beat
up
