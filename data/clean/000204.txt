Consid
the
cream
of

of

featur
by

it
is
definit
worth

I
do

I

which
I
'm
sure
most
of
you
know
Chanc
are
you
've
alreadi
seen
the
movi
and
are
just
wait
to
own
it
on
a
piec
of
media
that
wo
n't
rot
like
your

that
probabl
fell
apart
by
now
Even
if

you
'd

thi

Of

thi

as

I
actual

yet
so
I
can
not

on

I
just
watch

To
be

the

would
be
worth

I

Purchas
I
own
a

a

so
perhap
my
expect
were
too
high
but
despit
some
stellar
review
on
the
3D
on
thi
product
by
some
other
review
I
have
to
tell
you
the
qualiti
is
FAR
less
than
madefor3D
movi
such
as
Despic
MeDo
you
rememb
those
3D
gamescartoon
where
the
3D
effect
as
you
were
supposedli
either
walk
or
in
a
car
go
along
the
road
wa
the
part
closest
to
you
move
slow
then
there
wa
a
part
in
the
middl
that
move
a
bit
faster
and
then
the
part
near
the
top
of
the
screen
move
the
fastest
Thi
is
onli
a
step
abov
that
It
is
more
like
layer
2D
imag
than
true
3D
Ye
there
are
a
few
part
where
true
3D
is
appar
but
those
are
few
and
far
betweenSorri
I
ca
n't
help
but
think
that
some
of
the
peopl
have
either
let
their
love
of
the
movi
color
their
percept
of
what
good
3D
look
like
or
they
simpli
do
not
have
mani
3D
movi
to
compar
toI
actual
found
the
2D
bluray
disc
or
even
the
regular
dvd
more
appeal
or
at
least
less
distract
One
thing
I
notic
in
all
three
version
that
I
did
n't
notic
befor
wa
that
the
grass
in
the
movi
doe
n't
move
when
the
anim
walk
through
it
Although
I
did
n't
pick
up
on
thi
when
I
saw
the
movi
when
it
first
came
out
it
wa
one
of
the
thing
that
wa
pain
appar
in
the
3D
and
far
less
appar
in
the
2D
versionsAnd
ye
I
know
there
are
peopl
that
will
disagre
with
me
and
mark
my
review
as
not

I
have
to
call
it

THE
BEST
ANIM
FILM
By
A
Custom
on
Octob
19
1999Format
VH
Tape
After
the
movi
Littl
Mermaid
came
out
Disney
would
make
3
other
anim
masterpiec
Beauti
the
Beast
Aladdin
and
The
Lion
King
that
would
chang
the
way
we
look
at
anim
film
somth
new
someth
wonderfulBut
of
all
these
4
great
anim
film
in
my
opinion
The
Lion
King
wa
the
greatest
The
music
wa
just
beauti
and
Scar
wa
probabl
the
most
EVIL
Disney
villain
the
wa
ever
drawn
on
a
piec
of
paperY
hate
him
but
you
almost
like
him
becaus
he
wa
so
great
But
probabl
the
best
part
of
the
movi
wa
Simba
's
pal
's
Pumbaa
and
Timon
the
BEST
Disney
charact
EVER
The
scene
where
Timon
wa
do

I
thought
I
wa
go
to
die

Anybodi
from

Wow
I

thi

that
is
the

I
thoroughli
enjoy
thi
movi
's

stori
and
spiffi
charact
I
recommen
it
to
anyon
who
like
movi
period
Charcat
such
as
Timon
Pumba
bring
in
comed
relief
while
more
seriou
and
awesom
charact
such
as
Mufasa
help
bring
depth
and
feel
to
the
stori
I
dont

50
or
even

you
'll
simpli

If

what
the

would
have
to
say
the
blend
of

Buy

tri
the

Thi
