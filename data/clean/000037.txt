Think
Agatha

most
commonli
call
The
Queen
of
Crime
ha
an
extrem
vast
and
prestigi
repertoir
of
novel
such
as
The
Murder
of
Roger

whose
unexpect
plot
twist
earn
her
reput
and
Murder
on
the
Orient

most

featur
onli
a
group
of
peopl

The
vari

allow
the
reader
to
see
that
each
invit
come
from
a
differ
person
that
assum
variou

in
order
to
convinc
the
peopl
to
come
to
the
island
And
one

each

Each
person
on
the
island
is
rightli
suspici
and
it
bring
up
question
such
as
Who
is
the
killer
Am
I
next
and
Whi

The
answer
to
each
of
these
question
is
chill
but
also
utterli
unpredict
Other

We
will
also

thoroughli
as
it

so
full
of
shock
that
even

revel
would
spoil
some
surpris

I
am

that
you
would
