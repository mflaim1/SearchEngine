American

Mass
Market
Paperback
It
is
difficult
to
rememb
what
it
wa
like
to
read
thi
book
for
the
first
time
It
is
also
difficult
to
imagin
a
book
where
each
new
read
provid
so
much
more
illumin
into
the
main
charact
and
hi
person
I
can
rememb
find
Catcher
to
be
funni
the
first
time
I
read
it
I
now
altern
find
Holden
to
be
walk
a
fine
line
between
witti
sarcasm
and
danger
cynic
He
is
funni
there
is
no
way
around
that
but
hi
belittl
natur
also
caus
him
to
dismiss
much
from
hi
life
that
may
not
be
perfect
but
should
be
includ
There
is
noth
that
he
in
the
end
doe
not
dismiss
as
be
phoni
whether
it
is
the
nun
with
whom
he
share
a
cup
of
coffe
the
teacher
at
the
end
who
most
like
wa
just
tri
to
help
the
Egyptian
wing
of
the
museum
Pheob
's
schooleveryth
As
soon
as
one
littl
detail
slip
in
which
is
not
complet
on
track
with
what
he
is
think
whatev
it
is
he
is
contempl
becom
useless
phoni
not
worth
deal
with
Hi
humor
is
sharp
and
witti
and
I
often
laugh
out
loud
while
read
but
it
is
also
an
easi
way
for
him
to
detach
himself
from
a
world
which
he
no
longer
feel
he
belong
in
or
want
to
belong
in
I
can
rememb
find
the
end
ambigu
the
first
time
I
read
it
I
now
see
it
as
the
onli
way
it
could
end
with
Holden
find
happi
watch
hi
sister
Pheob
go
forev
in
circl
and
be
abl
to
pretend
that
that
is
never
go
to
chang
She
is
the
one
thing
in
hi
life
which
he
still
deem
worthi
of
exist
and
place
her
on
a
merrygoround
is
hi
best
attempt
to
keep
her
there
Thing
chang
and
grow
and
move
on
but
Holden
refus
to
accept
thi
and
is
yearn
to
stop
thing
forev
where
they
are
to
go
back
to
when
DB
wa
a
writer
full
of
dream
and
Alli
wa
still
aliveRead
