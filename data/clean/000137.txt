Everi
onc
in

while
the
convers
will

favorit
movi
I
'll
mention
Titan
and
at
least
a
coupl
peopl
will
snicker
I
pay
them
no
mind
becaus
I
know
that
five
year
ago
these
same
peopl
were
move
to
tear
by
that
veri
movi
And
they
're
too
embarrass
now
to
admit
itI
just
rewatch
Titan
for
the
first
time
in
a
long
time
Expect
to
simpli
enjoy
the
stori
again
I
wa
surpris
to
find
that
the
movi
ha
lost
none
of
it
power
over
these
five
year
I
cri
again
in
all
the
same
place
It
brought
me
back
to
1997
when
I
can
rememb
how
a
movi
that
no
one
thought
would
break
even
becam
the
most
popular
movi
of
all
time
A
movi
that
burst
into
the
public
conscious
like
no
other
movi
I
can
recal
ye
even
more
than
Star
War
And
today
mani

wo
n't

it
