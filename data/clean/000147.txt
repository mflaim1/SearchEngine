The
Aveng
Letâ
talk
about
it
shall
we
I
have
mani
question
in
my
head
when
I
watch
it
in
the
cinema
alongsid
my

and
brother
I
just
have
no

oneey
DIRECTOR
Nick
Furi
getsÂ
in
chargeÂ
of
thi
21st
Power
Ranger
team
so
call
the
Aveng
What
doe
he
do
actual
Give
play
card
to
Toni
Stark
to
boost
the
teamâ
spirit
He
is
useless
becaus
all
he
doe
is
actuallyÂ
shootingÂ
a
head
shot
on
level
guard
enemi
as
oppos
to
monster
and
alien
But
at
least
he
not
dead
by
the
end
of
the
movi
Honestli
speak
when
I
watch
Nick
Furi
do
all
the
talk
all
I
can
hear
is
Samuel
Jackson
verbal
abus
and
curs
the
âmotha
fuck
shitâ
out
of
someon
throughout
the
movi
Hi
way
of
stare
other
actor
never
waver
in
everi
of
hi
movi
Perhap
the
glare
nostril
crazi
killer
eye
and
jag
mouth
while
talk
made
him
infam
of
have
thi
charact
who
could
curs
ani
live
shit
on
earth
Perhap
one
of
Lokiâ
alien
armi
might
get
frighten
just
by
listen
to
Nickâ
curs
Iâm
not
say
Samuel
Jackson
fail
to
win
the
audienc
by
play
Nick
Furi
in
fact
he
is
there
to
entertain
most
of
the
audienc
He
is
inde
a
funni
person
My
brother
and
I
canât
stop
laugh
whenev
he
emerg
in
everi
scene
despit
hi
mighti
seriou
express
throughout
the
movi
Itâ
just
the
way
he
play
hi
role
depict
a
black
senior
look
gangster
in
a
cool
leather
jacket
with
an
eyepatch
on
hi
face
Itâ
just
phenomena
Enough
of
Nick
Furi
letâ
talk
about
Thor
When
Thor
jump
into
the
scene
by
a
light
cloud
while
Iron
man
and
Captain
America
hold
Loki
in
thi
jet
the
fight
scene
get
realli
intens
Loki
is
be
interrog
by
Thor
in
thi
rocki
mountain
and
Iron
Man
tackl
Thor
to
the
ground
while
Loki
watch
from
up
abov
The
cinematographi
and
the
impact
sound
effect
are
mix
perfectli
well
The
angl
they
shot
combin
it
with
great
CGI
I
honestli
canât
breath
at
that
time
Iâm
sure
everyon
is
glu
to
thi
scene
Then
Captain
America
throw
hi
shield
and
quickli
settl
the
short
quarrel
between
Ironman
and
Thor
So
hereâ
my
question
to
Thor
Whi
is
he
look
for
Loki
Whatev
happen
to
Natali
Portman
aka
Jane
Foster
I
specif
rememb
that
Jane
is
thi
Physician
correct
me
if
Iâm
wrong
on
thi
one
whom
Thor
fall
in
love
with
Then
when
Thor
get
to
Asgard
in
hi
own
movi
he
promis
to
meet
Jane
again
Whi
the
meet
between
these
two
love
bird
are
halt
and
never
shown
Thatâ
just
a
disappoint
in
my
part
Same
as
Captain
America
My
chest
itch
by
the
thought
of
Steve
Roger
aka
Captain
America
who
can
not
go
back
to
hi
WW2
era
and
blew
off
the
date
with
that
lieuten
girl
I
mean
itâ
just
sad
to
be
a
superhero
that
can
not
be
with
someon
he
realli
love
Although
in
the
last
scene
thereâ
thi
civilian
who
get
a
glimps
of
Captain
America
but
I
have
no
idea
who
is
that
girl
Bruce
Banner
is
play
by
Mark
Ruffalo
He
play
the
charact
realli
well
Hi
quirki
charact
a
cool
guy
who
ha
a
monster
within
him
and
the
part
where
he
shout
at
the
top
of
hi
lung
when
he
wa
interrog
by
black
Widow
now
that
wa
crazi
act
Ruffalo
ha
that
charact
in
him
After
all
he
look
like
a
wellbehav
doctor
who
ha
these
two
person
He
look
angrili
relax
from
the
outsid
but
hi
insid
live
the
crazi
Hulk
just
like
he
said
in
the
movi
â
my
secret
all
these
year
is
that
I
am
alway
angryâ
and
punch
thi
gigant
alien
caterpillar
to
sleep
by
just
one
strike
to
the
face
Occasion
when
he
turn
into
the
Hulk
he
like
to
runÂ
havoc
to
ani
of
hi
alli
and
foe
he
chase
down
the
Black
Widow

Thor

Hi
I
appreci
you
call
yourself
apprentic
writer
so
my
expect
were
not
too
high
in
read
thi
That
said
I
would
like
to
give
you
some
construct
feedback
Firstli
your
titl
You
ask
where
Jane
Foster
is
in
thi
movi
Well
her
pictur
Portman
is
shown
as
Phil
Coulson
tell
Thor
that
she
is
in
SHIELD
custodi
to
protect
her
from
Loki
Thi
is
clearli
state
So
though
she
doesnt
appear
she
get
a
mention
To
be
fair
consid
your
titl
she
realli
onli
get
a
brief
one
short
paragraph
out
of
11
realli
long
one
mention
in
your
articl
so
you
cant
realli
complain
Im
sure
she
will
be
in
the
next
Thor
movi
and
youll
get
to
see
them
make
out
plenti
But
thi
movi
wasnt
about
him
or
her
It
wa
an
Aveng
movi
Realli
the
clue
wa
in
the
titl
Im
also
sure
youll
get
to
see
Captain
America
find
true
live
in
hi
next
featur
Hell
I
know
that
the
onli
reason
I
go
to
see
comic
book
movi
Not
for
adventur
Not
for
fantasi
Not
for
great
fight
scene
No
It
all
about
the
kissi
kissi
Right
That
Bourn
Legaci
guy
or
Bourc
as
you
call
it
doesnt
play
Bourn
in
that
movi
Thi
is
just
one
of
the
mani
factual
inaccur
element
of
your
articl
It
also
one
of
the
mani
spell
mistak
and
horrend
grammar
Pleas
dont
get
me
start
on
the
structur
Oh
boy
Befor
you
post
someth
you
should
read
it
and
make
correct
I
wa
go
to
point
them
all
out
but
it
would
be
embarrass
for
you
Now
for
your
comparison
between
War
Machin
and
Nick
Furi
Actual
it
the
actor
you
compar
Im
still
tri
to
get
my
head
around
it
Mayb
thi
isnt
your
intent
but
there
is
someth
in
there
that
come
over
as
latent
racism
It
a
veri
strang
comment
to
make
A
actor
absent
from
the
film
paral
to
one
who
is
pure
on
the
basi
that
they
are
both
black
Whi
Your
final
comment
about
Spiderman
ha
me
perplex
He
appear
as
a
charact
in
veri
few
film
If
you
dislik
film
without
him
then
that
leav
onli
a
small
number
for
you
to
enjoy
As
such
Im
not
convinc
you
are
best
place
to
review
movi
Actual
till
your
rate
at
the
end
I
wa
not
even
awar
thi
wa
a
review
as
you
didnt
bother
to
do
that
in
the
preced
10
paragraph
There
are
mani
thing
wrong
here
but
I
hope
you
learn
from
thi
and

I
just
read
missymaycg
comment
and
it
look
pretti
respect
and
construct
to
me
Look
like
an
honest
opinion
come
from
an
avid
fan
of
these
type
of
movi
The
onli
reason
I
would
think
someon
would
be
hostil
toward
it
is
becaus
they
feel
threaten
I
also
read
Ellokai
about
me
page
and
I
think
he
is
just
stick
to
what
he
know
best
which
is
law
I
see
lawyer
as
peopl
who
have
to
be
200
confid
at
all
time
becaus
they
must
demand
respect
to
make
a
live
That
be
said
he
is
a
bit
out
of
hi
element
by
review
a
movi
whose
audienc
is
so
broad
that
it
would
be
kind
of
hard
to
display
your
domin
over
all
of
them
He
is
even
more
wrong
to
have
Jane
Foster
appear
more
time
in
the
titl
than
in
the
actual
articleexagger
but
sadli
not
by
much
Anyway
I
lost
my
train
of
thought
Aveng
wa
an
awesom
movi
Jeremi
Renner
is
awesom
Jane
Foster
wasnt
even
in
thi
articl
you
liar
And
I
hope

is

Get

what
im

to

is
that
