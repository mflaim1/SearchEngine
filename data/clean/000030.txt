Note
When
you
sell
a
man
a
book
you
do
n't
sell
him
just
12
ounc
of
paper
and
ink
and
glue
novelist
Christoph
Morley
said
you
sell
him
a
whole
new
life
Dure
the
past
50
year
more
book
have
been
sold
than
in
ani
other
time
in
histori
So
what
type
of
lifeor
as
Abraham
Kuyper
would
say
worldandlif
viewar
we
buy
As
a
partial
answer
to
that
question
we
've
ask
sever
Christian
thinker
to
examin
the
worldview
present
in
the
top
10
mostread
book
Over
the
next
sever
week
we
'll
present
articl
on
each
of
the
titl
Read
the
introduct
to
the
seri
by
Loui
Marko
One
of
the
disadvantag
we
have
with
book
written
in
our
lifetimea
compar
with
classic
book
from
other
erasi
kind
of
obviou
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
We
do
n't
know
which
one
will
be
classic
We
do
n't
know
who
to
put
into
the
lineup
Other
centuri
are
pick
on
us
unfairli
Those
other
gener
had
their
dreck
too
but
almost
none
of
that
surviv
the
test
of
time
Our
dreck
is
still
aliv
and
well
and
sell
briskli
So
when
we
make
a
comparison
we
tend
to
imagin
that
the
14th
centuri
had
a
Chaucer
on
everi
other
corner
while
our
ha
an
E
L
Jame
in
everi
Starbuck
The
game
is
lopsid
becaus
all
they
have
to
do
is
put
in
their
first
string
We
are
requir
to
put
in
anybodi
from
the
student
bodi
who
think
he
might
be
abl
to
play
a
littl
But
imagin
what
the
test
of
real
time
will
do
to
our
literatur
that
is
not
worth
preserv
Imagin
what
it
will
look
like
when
our
centuri
and
the
last
one
have
that
huge
neighborhood
garag
sale
the
one
where
we
sell
off
all
our
old
Book
of
the
Month
Club
select
at
a
nickel
a
box
What
will
we
keep
What
will
be
left
over
I
want
to
argu
that
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
will
be
among
the
keeper
And
schoolchildren
sever
centuri
henc
will
then
be
abl
to
imagin
that
the
20th
centuri
wa
a
time
of
literari
giant
all
of
them
with
a
Christian
worldviewwhen
there
wa
a
Tolkien
on
everi
corner
Not
Just
Harri
Potter
for
GrownUp
I
have
taught
cours
in
Tolkien
and
in
Lewi
and
whenev
you
do
thi
the
teacher
ha
quit
a
daunt
challeng
If
I
were
to
teach
a
cours
in
Georg
Herbert
or
T
S
Eliot
or
Shakespear
I
would
get
student
enrol
in
the
class
who
were
interest
and
engag
of
cours
But
with
a
class
on
Tolkien
you
will
invari
get
one
or
more
student
who
have
the
entir
middl
section
of
The
Silmarillion
memor
No
no
Beren
and
Lúthien
went
through
the
Gate
after
they
had
put
that
spell
on
Carcharoth
The
same
disadvantag
attend
ani
who
would
write
about
Tolkien
as
well
And
so
I
begin
thi
modest
discuss
suitabl
abash
Those
who
dismiss
The
Lord
of
the
Ring
as
simpli
Harri
Potter
for
grownup
or
as
a
sourc
of
bumper
sticker
materi
for
age
hippi
to
put
on
their
Volvo
Not
all
those
who
wander
are
lost
have
realli
miss
the
central
prophet
vision
of
the
booksa
prophet
stanc
taken
against
modern
or
perhap
what
we
might
want
to
call
mordorn
Thi
is
the
prophet
element
that
make
Tolkien
's
vision
a
fundament
Christian
one
There
are
place
where
I
prefer
Lewi
's
Protest
take
to
Tolkien
's
Catholic
obvious
but
on
thi
issu
Tolkien
reflect
the
ethic
perspect
of
the
entir
Christian
tradit
Just
becaus
you
can

The
Gospel
as
Power
Under
Thi
is
the
wisdom
that
acknowledg
the
small
are
great
the
last
are
first
the
humbl
are
exalt
and
the
servant
are
lord
For
those
who
think
in
carnal
categori
power
is
alway
power
over
and
thi
mean
that
for
them
the
differ
between
white
magic
and
black
magic
ha
to
be
power
over
for
good
end
and
power
over
for
evil
end
But
the
gospel
is
power
under
Jesu
humbl
himself
in
obedi
even
to
the
point
of
death
on
a
cross
and
God
ha
therefor
highli
exalt
him
and
given
him
the
name
that
is
abov
everi
name
Think
of
it
thi
way
The
council
of
Elrond
determin
that
they
would
not
be
seduc
by
the
concept
of
total
war
They
are
unalter
oppos
to
Sauron
and
hi
work
and
so
they
decid
that
they
will
under
no
circumst
becom
Sauron
themselv
A
ring
come
into
their
possess
and
it
is
a
ring
that
would
enabl
them
to
overthrow
Sauron
complet
but
with
a
price
They
could
defeat
Sauron
by
becom
Sauron
The
charact
who
refus
to
use
the
ring
in
thi
way
are
manyElrond
Gandalf
Faramir
Galadriel
Sam
and
for
a
veri
long
time
Frodo
Boromir
fall
prey
to
the
temptat
pose
by
the
ring
but
it
seen
by
all
the
rest
of
them
as
just
that
a
temptat
that
hi
particular
kind
of
strength
wa
too
weak
to
resist
At
the
end
of
hi
journey
when
Frodo
final
succumb
to
the
power
of
the
ring
and
put
it
on
stand
on
the
lip
of
the
crevic
go
down
into
Mt
Doom
Sauron
wa
suddenli
awar
of
him
and
the
magnitud
of
hi
own
folli
wa
reveal
to
him
in
a
blind
flash
The
Return
of
the
King
Sauron
ha
no
categori
for
a
strategi
against
him
conceiv
in
humil
The
idea
that
someon
could
come
into
possess
of
a
ring
that
would
grant
univers
power
to
the
one
who
possess
it
and
who
would
then
not
tri
to
use
it
as
he
would
use
it
had
never
enter
hi
mind
Inde
given
what
kind
of
mind
it
wa
it
could
not
enter
hi

A
Cruciform
Stori
C

Lewi
onc
point
out
that
Tolkien
's
ring
of
power
wa
not
a
code
messag
against
the
atom
bomb
and
that
the
chronolog
of
the
write
made
such
a
reconstruct
imposs
At
the
same
time
the
ring
of
power
is
a
clarion
statement
against
thoughtless
use
of
everi
form
of
rightfist
powerfrom
the
crossbow
to
the

Thi
is
anoth
way
of
say
that
the
plot

in
The
Lord
of

are
cruciform
