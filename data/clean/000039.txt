ha
a
special
way
of
get
under
my
skin
and
make
me
look
over
my
shoulder
the
way
all
good
suspens
psycholog
murder
mysteri
will
doÂ
Thi
bookÂ
creep
me
out
as
a
child
and
didnt
fail
to
do
so
thi
time
around
And
Then
There
Were
NoneÂ
beginsÂ
with
ten
stranger
Â
journey
to
spend
time
on
Indian
Island
after
each
receiv
a
care
word
invit
to
spendÂ
time
on
the
island
Â
None
of
the
travel
have
ani
real
idea
of
who
will
meet
them
and
each
onli
vagu
rememb
the
friend
from
whom
they
have
receiv
their
correspond
but
they
have
heard
rumorsÂ
of
an
actress
that
may
or
not
own
the
properti
and
on
wild
go
on
at
the
properti
Â
Each
ha
a
strong
motivationÂ
for
want
to
be
anywher
but
home
The
visitor
to
the
island
are
surprisedÂ
to
realiz
that
neither
host
nor
hostess
are
on
the
island
and
when
a
terribl
record
come
on
a
dinner
announc
crime
that
each
of
them
have
purportedli
commit
mysteri
death
start
to
occur
Â
It
doesnt
take
the
group
long
to
figur
out
that
they
have
been
luredÂ
to
the
island
to
beÂ
execut
for
crime
that
ha
long
gone
unpunish
Â
They
also
realiz
that
the
execution
ha
to
be
one
of
them
The
begin
of
the
novel
bore
me
a
bit
as
all
the
charact
were
be
introduc
They
were
hard
to
keep
track
of
and
my
adult
self
agre
withÂ
my
twelveyearold
selfÂ
in
wantingÂ
them
to
get
along
with
it
Â
I
wa
grate
when
some
of
the
charact
were
pickedÂ
off
becaus
there
were
just
too
mani
storiesÂ
Â
It
wa
a
curiou
experinceÂ
to
watch
event
unfold
becaus
whileÂ
I
didnt
like
ani
of
the
victim
there
wa
a
Â
terrorÂ
in
imagin
myself
inÂ
their
posit
and
that
occupi
me
more
thanÂ
care
about
them
Â
I
also
want
to
see
who
wa
next
and
in
what
unexpect
way
their
murder
would
occur
and
match
up
with
the
nurseri
rhyme
AndÂ
Then
There
Were
NoneÂ
ha
a
terrifi
premis
and
Christi
prove
to
be
the
master
of
suspens
she
is
abl
to
build
the
spine
tingl
factor
in
spite
of
a
rather
implaus
plot
Â
Would
you
realli
go
traips
off
to
some
island
without
talk
to
your
host
Â
Without
know
them
well
Â
Without
have
spoken
to
them
in
year
Â
All
of
these
folk
do
and
while
I
didnt
buy
it
complet
it
ultim
doesnt
matter
TheÂ
stori
work
anyway
Â
I
wa
on
the
edg
of
my
seat
the
entir
time
that
I
wa
read
Im
not
sure
if
thi
is
one
of
these
novel
where
you
actual
have
the
clue
to
figur
it
out
beforehand
Â
In
spite
of
have
read
thi
book
befor
it
wa
long
enough
ago
that
while
I
rememb
how
the
killer
wa
do
thing
I
didnt
rememb
who
it
wa
Â
I
had
a
strong
suspicion
though
Â
The
manner
in
which
the
killer
is
revealedÂ
did
leav
someth
to
beÂ
desir
but
the
beauti
of
what
Christi
accomplish
with
thi
one
still
remain
intact
and
is
definit
worth
a
read
