state
Thi
is
actual
a
veri
uniqu
experi
for

Iâv
work
on

where
there
have
been
a
number
of
star
and
certainli
work
on
film
where
there
have
been
charact
of
equal
weight
in
term
of
their
level
of
import
and
profil
in
the
film
but
thi
one
is
somewhat
extrem
in
that
regard
becaus
each
of
these
charact
ha
their
own
world
and
itâ
a
veri
differ
situat
Itâ
veri
challeng
to
look
for
a
way
to
give
everyon
the
weight
and
consider
they
need
but
at
the
same
time
the
film
is
realli
about
the
come
togeth
of
these
charact
which
impli
that
there
is

as
old
school
say
the
score
is
veri
oldfashion
which
is
whi
Silvestri
wa
letter
perfect
for

he
can
give
you
the

school
of
'Iâm
