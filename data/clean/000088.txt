Ive
been
a
bit
sluggish
in
the
read
depart
thi
summer
but
I
guess
that
is
the
onli
good
thing
about
summer
endingIl
most
like
get
back
to
my
normal
read
speed
and
be
abl
to
write
a
read
roundup
post
a
bit
more
frequent
than
everi
coupl
of
month
Close
Your
Eye
Hold
Hand
I
first
read
a
Chri
Bohjalian
novel
last
year
The
Sandcastl
Girl
and
wa
immedi
hook
on
hi
write
I
follow
up
by
read
The
Light
in
the
Ruin
When
I
first
heard
about
a
new
book
of
hi
come
out
thi
year
I
got
veri
excit
My
excit
slightli
lessen
when
I
found
out
it
wasnt
a
histor
fiction
work
While
I
will
alway
prefer
histor
fiction
to
plain
fiction
Bohjalian
latest
work
still
pack
a
pretti
mean
punch
and
I
mean
that
in
the
best
of
way
It
tell
the
stori
of
Emili
a
teenag
who
becom
homeless
follow
a
meltdown
at
the
localÂ
nuclear
plant
where
both
of
her
parent
work
It
said
her
dad
wa
drunk
on
the
day
of
the
meltdown
and
is
be
blame
for
the
disasterÂ
sinc
he
wa
the
one
in
charg
With
both
of
her
parent
miss
and
presum
dead
Emili
flee
her
town
rather
than
be
subject
to
question
and
scrutini
She
end
up
homeless
and
journey
into
a
world
that
no
one
at
ani
age
should
ever
know
It
wasnt
necessarili
graphicÂ
but
it
wa
still
hard
to
read
in
some
part
know
that
there
are
mani
real
life
Emili
out
there
As
alway
Bohjalian
doe
an
incred
job
in
weav
an
engross
stori
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
When
I
wa
younger
I
wa
obsess
with
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
throughÂ
the
televis
movi
that
were
made
from
the
novel
I
watch
them
over
and
over
and
could
recit
dialogu
verbatim
in
some
scene
While
I
had
read
an
abridg
version
of
the
famou
classic
by
LM
Montgomeri
I
had
never
actual
read
the
entir
book
So
last
month
I
final
did
and
honestli
in
much
of
the
book
I
could
imagin
the
scene
from
the
movi
Unlik
some
novel
to
screen
adapt
in
which
plotsÂ
are
drastic
chang
the
movi
wa
just
like
the
book
You
will
love
the
charact
of
Ann
in
either
medium
And
for
anyon
not
familiar
with
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
I
dont
see
how
thi
is
possibl
but
on
the
off
chanc
it
tell
the
stori
of
Ann
Shirley
an
orphan
girl
who
end
up
live
withÂ
two
middl
age
sibl
on
their
farm
While
they
had
origin
want
a
boy
to
help
with
the
chore
they
end
up
keep
Ann
and
it
is
the
best
thing
for
everyon
Ann
of
Green
Gabl
is
a
delight
read
for
peopl
of
ani
age
and
if
your
like
me
it
will
not
onli
take
you
back
to
your
childhood
but
make
you
so
want
to
visit
Princ
Edward
Island
and
the
hous
that
inspir
LM
Montgomeri
when
she
wrote
her
tale
Orphan
Train
I
actual
read
thi
last
year
but
never
wrote
about
it
befor
Christina
Baker
Kline
novel
tell
two
stori
that
are
woven
togeth
concern
Molli
a
teenag
in
the
foster
care
system
who
doesnt
quit
fit
in
and
Vivian
an
elderli
woman
with
a
mysteri
past
While
Molli
and
Vivian
stori
are
set
in
the
present
time
there
is
also
the
back
stori
of
Vivian
as
a

girl
When
just
a
child
she
wa

and
sent
on
an
orphan
train
west
out
of
New
York
Citi
to
what
wa
suppos
to
be
a
better
life
in
the
Midwest
even
though
girl
Vivian
age
were
gener
onli
adopt
to
work
not
becaus
the
adopt
famili
actual
care
about
them
I
didnt
realli
care
for
the

part
sinc
I
found
the
charact
of
Molli
to
be
the
typic
obnoxi
teenag

a
chip
on
her
shoulder
Howev
Vivian
stori

My
heart
also
broke
over
the
mani
heartach
and
tragedi

endur
for
someon
