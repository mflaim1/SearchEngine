SpiderMan

Right
Oscar
and
award
done
with
for
anoth
year
It
's
nearli
blockbust
season
now
And
few
areÂ
bigger
or
enjoy
more
anticip
than
Joss
Whedon
's
Aveng
Age
Of
Ultron
the
sequel
to
the
third
highest
gross
film
of
all
time
For
hi
encor
Joss
Whedon
appear
not
to
be
rest
on
hi
laurel
Inde
in
hi
latest
interview
with
Empir
The
Aveng
director
certainli
made
it
clear
hi
ambit
were
fairli
high
even
pure
in
term
of
influenc
I
know
I
refer
Godfath
Part
II
a
lot
he
said
'Donât
refer
the
greatest
movi
ever
made
becaus
thatâ
Icaru
you
moronâ
But
at
the
same
time
it
is
a
huge
touchston
for
me
becaus
you
get
everyth
you
got
from
the
first
Godfath
movi
in
a
veri
differ
movi
in
a
movi
that
structur
couldnât
be
more
differ
and
themat
and
in
intent
and
in
mood
and
yet
nobodi
ever
goe
âit
wasnât
Godfatheri
enough
'
I
need
to
give
peopl
an
excit
ride
about
heroic
peopl
and
thatâ
certainli
part
of
whi
I
sign
on
but
at
the
same
time
a
richer
deeper
darker
movi
is
not
a
bad
thing
In
that
vein
Whedon
also
reveal
that
he
ha
a
new
kind
of
villain
that
he
is
ground
to
be
the
megalomaniac
foil
to
hi
superhero
The
power
in
the
comic
book
â
theyâr
alway
like
'and
then
I
can
revers
the
polar
of
your
ionsâ
â
well
we
have
to
ground
thing
a
lot
more
With
Ultron
we
have
to
make
him
slightli
less
omnipot
becaus
heâd
win
Bottom
line
Also
have
weak
and
need
and
foibl
and
allianc
and
actual
care
what
peopl
think
of
him
all
these
thing
are
what
make
him
a
charact
and
not
just
a
tidal
wave
A
movi
about
a
tidal
wave
can
be
great
but
itâ
differ
than
a
conflict
between
one
side
and
the
otherso
the
power
he
ha
are
slightli
differ
â
he
can
control
certain
thing
heâ
not
just
fire
repulsor
And
then
Whedon
sprung
to
the
defenc
of
Sam
Raimi
's
malign
includ
by
Raimi
himselfÂ
SpiderMan

When
discuss
Quicksilv
and
Scarlet
Witch
he
reveal
that
theyâr
alreadi
good
to
go
by
the
time
weâr
up
and
run
You
donât
want
to
fall
into
SpiderMan
3
territori
â
and
I
say
that
as
a
guy
who
actual
think
pretti
well
of
that
movi
thereâ
some
great
stuff
in
that
movi
â
but
there
come
a
point
where
