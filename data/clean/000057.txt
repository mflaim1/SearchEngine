The
Da
Vinci
Code
The
truth
behind
the
code
When
I
took
the
decis
of
sit
down
and
read
the
book
it
wa
becaus
of
the
high
recommend
that
it
had
receiv
from
all
my
friend
and
teacher
I
myself
am
not
much
of
a
reader
but
as
soon
as
I
start
read
the
book
I
just
could
n't
let
go
of
it
After
read
thi
book
I
can
certainli
say
that
Dan
Brown
is
a
true
geniu
The
Da
Vinci
code
is
a
masterpiec
It
's
one
of
those
book
that
are
uniqu
and
that
are
alway
go
to
be
a
must
read
It
start
out
with
a
murder
case
but
it
is
n't
your
typic
case
of
find
out
who
it
is
Dan
Brown
is
sure
of
leav
more
than
evid
toward
the
true
secret
behind
thi
murder
case
that
ha
more
behind
it
than
just
a
guilti
assassin
I
assur
you
that
throughout
the
whole
journey
that
the
protagonist
Robert
Langdon
and
Sophi
Nevu
undergo
you
will
feel
the
tension
and
the
passion
for
find
out
the
secret
that
Da
Vinci
ha
left
for
us
You
will
feel
nervou
you
will
feel
sad
and
disappoint
when
you
ca
n't
find
out
the
secret
and
you
will
utter
satisfact
you
will
end
up
with
an
open
mouth
It
ha
all
the
characterist
of
a
mysteryadventur
novel
that
will
make
you
enjoy
thi
book
as
if
you
're
Robert
of
Sophi
themselv
I
'm
certain
that
you
wo
n't
be
abl
to
think
about
anyth
els
when
you
're
not
read
the
book
Besid
all
thi
incred
characterist
it
also
ha
a
small
dose
of
love
between
the
2
main
charact
that
throughout
the
whole
book
you
can
see
the
obviou
chemistri
that
exist
between
them
So
for
all
those
reader
who
like
the
unexpect
thi
is
your
book
when
you
're
sure
that
that
's
the
guy
or
that
they
have
solv
the
mysteri
I
assur
you
you
will
be
wrong
the
truth
will
blow
your
mind
One
of
the
thing
that
I
most
enjoy
wa
the
fact
that
sever
thing
were
happen
at
the
same
time
with
differ
charact
the
author
give
you
just
the
amount
of
inform
about
what
's
happen
with
one
charact
to
leav
you
hook
and
then
will
go
and
tell
you
in
the
next
chapter
what
's
happen
with
the
other
charact
and
ALSO
LEAV
YOU
HOOK
so
you
wo
n't
be
abl
to
stop
read
you
will
read
faster
and
faster
hold
your
breath
to
the
sudden
twist
the
book
take
and
be
breathless
by
the
end
of
it
Although
Dan
Brown
's
literatur
as
a
whole
may
not
be
veri
good
it
is
apt
for
mani
age
and
great
to
be
read
as
a
fiction
fun
book
that
will
leav
you
with
a
sweet
tast
of
mouth
When
finish
the
Da
Vinci
code
you
will
want
to
read
more
of
Dan
Brown
The
Da
Vinci
Code
is
an
amaz
book
and
I
dare
rate
it
without
a
doubt
a
5
star
book
What
's
great
about
Dan
Brown
is
that
he
doe
n't
stop
hi
masterpiec
here
he
continu
hi
extravag
write
in
book
like
Angel
and
Demon
Digit
Fortress
and
Decept
point
so
I
can
say
without
a
doubt
that
Dan
Brown
is
one
of
top
author
of
thi
age

a
creativ

insight
There
were
some
thing
I
did
n't
like
about
the
book
howev
Throughout
the
book
Dan
Brown
use
French
word
in
the
dialogu
He
doe
n't
includ
a
glossarywel
not
in
the
paperback
edit
at
leastand
sometim
I
have
to
skip
over
the
French
word
or
use
my
imagin
to
figur
out
what
they
mean
Also
the
descript
of
the
Louvr
for
instanc
seem
like
they
come
out
of
a
travel
brochur
Honestli
I
did
n't
need
to
know
everi
singl
detail
of
the
Louvr
becaus
I
saw
it
on
the
Internet
befor
You
should
read
The
DaVinci
Code
if
you
have
an
interest
in
code
and
puzzl
conspiraci
and
mysteri
Dan
Brown
doe
an
excel
job
of
explain
hi
idea
up
to
the
point
where
a
teenag
can
understand
Thi
is
what
I
like
about
Dan
Brown
He
is
abl
to
captiv
hi
audienc
with
controversi
topic
while
remind
us
that
hi
book
are
fiction
I
highli
recommend
thi

to
peopl
of

If

It

When

Then
one

recommend
it
to

I
am

a

harder
each

Lukewarm
about
'Da

Is
it
possibl
to
give
thi
book
a
middl
rate
rather
than
go
to
one
extrem
or
anoth
Sure
Here
's
whi
For
starter
the
book
is
in
fact
a
page
turner
Onc
I
start
read
it
I
did
n't
want
to
stop
Whi
Becaus
everi
chapter
leav
you
hang
on
the
edg
wait
for
the
next
step
in
the
adventur
While
that
is
effect
at
keep
a
reader
involv
it
also
left
me
feel
like
I
wa
be
strung
along
and
that
the
payoff
could
n't
measur
up
to
the
expect
I
wa
right
It
did
n't
'The
Da
Vinci
Code
'
is
altogeth
entertain
and
subsequ
altogeth
forgett
It
's
actual
been
over
a
year
sinc
I
read
the
book
and
if
it
had
n't
been
for
the
movi
refresh
my
memori
a
bit
I
would
have
forgotten
most
of
the
major
plot
point
by
now
The
onli
part
that
stuck
with
me
were
Dan
Brown
's
antagonist
flog
of
Christian
doctrin
without
ani
real
basi
for
the
wild
claim
he
wa
make
and
the
imag
of
an
ascet
albino
murder
monk
Sila
wa
much
more
memor
than
ani
of
the
protagonist
Oh
I
also
enjoy
the
descript
of
Rosslyn
Chapel
although
that
is
mostli
becaus
I
am
interest
in
anyth
deal
with
Scottish
histori
That
's
about
it
The
charact
are
mostli
forgett
becaus
Brown
move
so
quickli
through
the
stori
that
there
is
no
time
for
develop
If
you
MUST
read
someth
by
Dan
Brown
'Angel
and
Demon
'
is
better
Better
plot
progress
more
vivid
locat
more
excit
climax
more
bewild
plot
twist
and
a
littl
less
sacrilegi
although
even
more
abras
toward
Catholic
particularli
the
Vatican
Charact
remain
on
the
shallow
side
If
you
choos
to
buy
either
of
Brown
's
Langdon
seri
book
get
the
illustr
edit
I
might
not
have
even
bother
to
read
them
without
the
picturesthey
add
to
the
stori
immens
Have
said
all
that
I
will
probabl
read
Brown
's
next
Langdon
novel
I
am
curiou
what
he
is
go
to
do
with
Freemasonri
Perhap
he
will
also
take
time
to
give
Robert
Langdon
some
backstori
and
provid
him
with
a
few
friendli
human
link
that
extend
beyond
the
scope
of
the
manic
