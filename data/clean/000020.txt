From
thi
pictur
what
did
you
see
Make
a
guess
while
I
continu
the
review
It
start
as
a
veri
play
fanci
stori
the
adult
narrat
is
disillus
with
the
world
of
grownup
becaus
whenev
he
show
them
a
pictur
he
drew
of
a
boa
constrictor
that
had
eaten
an
eleph
everyon
think
it
is
a
hat
But
one
day
when
he
crash
hi
plane
in
the
Sahara
he
encount
a
littl
boy
in
the
middl
of
the
desert
who
not
onli
recognis
the
draw
for
what
it
is
but
claim
he
came
from
an
asteroid
As
the
narrat
get
to
know
the
boy
more
he
piec
togeth
hi
histori
Unfortun
the
littl
princ
stori
is
notÂ
without
sad
He
ha
left
behind
a
rose
he
care
about
veri
much
and
hi
travel
sinc
thenÂ
have
left
him
lost
on
the
Earth
a
planet
much
larger
and
more
bewild
than
the
asteroid
he
is
use
to
He
then
hop
from
one
asteroid
to
anoth
meet
men
who
are
conceit
drunk
busi
man
go
about
âmatter
of
consequenceâ
yet
the
littl
princ
canât
find
hi
rose
The
fox
that
the
littl

met
is
truli
a
wise
one
as
mani
wisdom
sprout
out
of
him
One
see
clearli
onli
with
the
heart
What
is
essenti
is
invis
to
the
eye
You
becom
respons

for
what
you
have
tame
and
It
is
the
time
you
have
devot
to
your
rose
that
make
your
rose
so
import
The
Littl
PrinceÂ
is
about
what
truli
matter
in
life
and
the
one
person
that
you
love
in
life
The
littl
princ
went
away
to
look
again
at
the
rosesâ
âYou
are
beauti
but
you
are
emptyâ
he
went
on
âOne
could
not
die
for
you
To
be
sure
an
ordinari
passerbi
would
think
that
my
rose
look
just
like
you
â
the
rose
that
belong
s
to
me
But
in
herself
alon
she
is
more
import
than
all
the
hundr
of
you
other
rose
becaus
it
is
she
that
I
have
water
becaus
it
is
she
that
I
have
shelter
behind
the
screen
âbecaus
it
is
she
that
I
have
listen
to
when
she
grumbl
or
boast
or
even
sometim
when
she
said
