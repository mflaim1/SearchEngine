notic
that
Dan

even
make
it
clear
to

through
hi
charact
word
that
he
doe
n't
want
to
destroy
christian
becaus
it
ha
done

so
mani
peopl
and
if
it

let
's
let
them
continu
to
do
what
work
for
them
but
find
your
own
path
if
you
were
or
are
a
Christian
ask
yourself
about
the
topic
in
thi
book
They
are
so

Mayb
the

LIKE
thi
becaus
it
wa
a

to
the
church
total
possibl
The
cathol
church
creat
the
biblic
canon
with
a
polit
agenda
to
wipe
out
pagan
actual
thi
seem
to
be
a
fact
women
be
oppress
due
to
the
fear
of
relig
zealot
men
in
power
lose
their
powernev
look
at
it
that
way
but
thi
seem
to
be
a
fact
too
is
it
help
in
broaden
my
perspect
of
the
fact
that
christian
is
just
a
religion
made
by
fallibl
peopl
it
sure
is
doe
it
open
my
mind
to
other
faith
like
pagan
judiasm
islam
bhuddism
and
want
to
take
the
truth
from
all
of
them
and
then
THINK

is
ridicul
To

spend

The

Not

Thi

it

our

ha
been
poison
by

Final
Brown

simplist

it
is
not

the

one
that
need

More

Hello

NEVER

And
some
of
the

are

plain

Harvard
Professor
of
Symbolog
still
make
me
laugh
everi
time
I
think
about
it
Robert
Langdon
a
tweedi
brainiac
and
French
polic
cryptologist
Sophi
Neveu
who
is
tout
as
brilliant
but
who
spend
most
of
the
time
play
second
fiddl
to
Langdon
's
encycloped
knowledg
as
they
run
around
Europ
in
about
a
48hour
time
period
I
believ
be
chase
by
the
Evil
Cathol
Church
the
French
polic
and
assort
other
baddi
Thi
Europewid
clue
chase
ha
been
set
in
train
by
Sophi
's
grandfath
who
while
be
murder
somehow
manag
to
set
up
a
ridicul
elabor
trail
to
lead
our
hero
to
the
Big
SecretConfus
Rememb
the
movi
where
Tom
Hank
spend
99
of
the
time
with
a
puzzl
frown
on
hi
face
and
the
dumbest
hairstyl
I
have
EVER
seen
him
wearimag
errorThat
frown
is
reflect
on
my
face
as
I
tri
to
figur
out
how
in
the
world
thi
novel
got
to
be
so
popular
I
think
the
answer
lie
in
the
fact
that
if
you
just
give
up
on
ani
attempt
to
analyz
what
DB
is
posit
do
n't
worri
about
the
write
and
just
go
with
the
flow
you
get
a
pageturn
that
hurtl
you
toward
the
point
where
you
are
merci
done
with
the
book
That
's
what
that
second
star
is
for
And
there
are
ton
of
peopl
who
love
all
that
esotericmysteri
stuff
plu
the
book
came
to
the
attent
of
a
certain
type
of
Christian
who
is
veri
easi
to
bait
into
perceiv
ani
critic
of
ani
aspect
of
Christian
as
A
HUGE
THREAT
and
the
result
kerfuffl
must
have
had
DB
's
publicist
offer
up
heartfelt
prayer
of
thanksgivingNop
I
'm
still
puzzl
On
my
second
time
around
I
realli
paid
attent
to
the
write
and
came
to
the
conclus
that
The
Da
Vinci
Code
is
a
truli
execr
piec
of
prose
that
manag
to
includ
just
about
everi
mistak
wannab
novelist
are
told
to
avoid
I
particularli
love
the
way
you
're
in
the
middl
of
an
excit
chasearound
and
then
the
action
suddenli
GRIND
TO
A
HALT
while
Langdon
launch
into
yet
anoth
of
hi
explan
And
the
bit
where
DB
wa
obvious
write
with
a
map
of
Pari
and
a
guidebook
at
hi
elbow
so
that
you
get
turnbyturn
street
nav
and
a
guid
tour
of
wherev
they
happen
to
be
down
to
the
exact
dimens
of
the
roomAnd
can
you
say
plot
illog
And
what
about
the
Move
Bodi
Part
Langdon
's
eye
follow
her
arm
to
the
structur
ahead
And
DB
's
cringeworthili
bad
understand
of
British
well
everyth
as
personifi
in
Sir
Lee
Tebe
't
wa
an
audiobook
so
the
spell
may
be
wrong
I
person
like
Surli
TBing
The
other
charact
even
those
who
should
have
known
kept
call
him
Sir
Tebe
it
should
be
Sir
Lee
and
even
at
one
gloriou
moment
your
knightship
And
he
put
clot
cream
in
hi
tea
pleas
see
thi
discuss
so
I
do
n't
have
to
go
over
it
again
Last
but
definit
not
least
there
wa
suppos
to
be
some
sexual
attract
between
Langdon
and
Neveu
but
ani
time
DB
went
there
it
wa
as
awkward
as
watch
your
brother
come
on
to
your
BFF
There
's
someth
eerili
virgin
about
Langdon
which
I
swear
manag
to
commun
itself
to
Hank
Never
have
I
seen
the
Tom
look
less
attractiveThi
is
definit
not
the
best
book
to
listen
to
as
an
audiobook
unless
you
are
veri
veri
masochist
The
narrat
ha
to
do
huge
chunk
of
the
stori
in
a
French
accent
and
then
there
's
Lee
Tebe
who
got
a
ludicr
overblown
stage
British
heehaw
voic
in
my
version
Then
there
wa
the
pronunci
of
Louvr
as
LOOV
and
Tuileri
as
TOOLERI
but
you
know
I
've
got
to
hand
it

My
feel
about
Dan
Brown
were
similar
So
the
letter
point
out
that
Ms
Patterson
wa
just
cherrypick
her
author
As
far
as
I
wa
awar
she
wa
quit
correct
in
say
that
Shakespear
Dicken
and
Tolstoy
did
n't
do
puzzl
and
treasurehunt
but
if
she
'd
want
to
argu
the
contrari
posit
she
could
just
as
easili
have
cite
Lewi
Carrol
Jame
Joyc
and
Vladimir
Nabokov
The
real
problem
with
Dan
Brown
wa
not
the
subject
matter
but
the
qualiti
of
the
writingSigh

thought
I

Thank
to
PG

for

though
I
did

up

what
did
I

poor

unconvinc

to
form

work
The
fact
that
anyon
took
thi
work
serious
in
ani
capac
is
amaz
to
me
The
charact
are
flat
bore
and
none
of
them
exceed
two
dimens
at
best
The
âhistoryâ
is
so
riddl
with
hole
as

observ
my
favorit
part
is
the
explan
of
how
the
Churchâ
desir
to
destroy
the
âsacr
feminineâ
is
respons
for
Orthodox
Jew
and
devout
Muslim
bar
women

final
the

just
make

Even
the
much
vaunt
puzzl
are
fairli
trite
and
usual
explain
so
quickli
that
itâ
bare

The
final
puzzl
that
the

mindbogglingli
obviou
that
anyon
who
know
how
to
draw
a
Mogen
David
Star
of

can

it
out
instantlySo
the
question
for
me
becam
thi
given
how
aw
thi
book
is
whi
the
hell
is
it
so
popular
I
can
offer
the
follow
explanationsobservationsFirst
off
Brown
employ
a
clever
and
I
use
the
term
loos
narr
structur
in
which
he
end
everi
singl
chapter
on
a
cliffhang
Thi
forc
the
reader
to
continu
read
hope
to
reach
a
payoff
or
stop
point
that
is
never
quit
realiz
Thu
the
reader
keep
go
to
the
next
chapter
hope
to
final
hit
a
point
where
the
stori
will
relax
onli
to
discov
that
the
stori
never
realli
relax
It
just
plod
relentlessli
forward
like
the
Termin

Sarah

with
a
SuDoKu
puzzleIn
a
similar
vein
Brown
keep
hi
chapter
short
In
fact
Iâv
read
vers
poetri
that
wa
longer
than
some
of
the
chapter
in
thi
book
and
consider
better
written
Thi
help
the
reader
feel
as
though
they
are
make
progress
becaus
theyâr
suddenli
on
Chapter
44
and
can
reach
Chapter
50
with
onli
a
few
extra
minut
of
read
Hooray
for
the
short
attent
spanLikewis
Brown
tap
into
some
popular
polit
and
histor
fallaci
that
are
guarante
to
make
him
welllik
Name
that
the
Cathol

is
an
evil
conspiraci
Christian
is
one
of
the
few
religion
itâ
still

The
stori
is
fiction
after
all
and
one
should
expect
to
have
hisher
credul
stretch
especi
when
read
pulp
that
is
written
with
the
screen
in
mind
as
The
Da
Vinci
Code
sure
wasI
even
enjoy
the
Sunday
afternoon
it
took
me
to
read
The
Da
Vinci
Code
It
wa
an
absolut
wast
of
time
and
exactli
what
I
want
to
be
do
sit
on
a
comfi
sofa
drink
tea
and
read
about
selfflagel
albino
monk
and
other
fun
thingsI
've
given
mani
book
that
are
just
as
good
as
The
Da
Vinci
Code
and
even
some
that
are
wors
three
star
and
I
meant
everi
star
The
truth
is
that
on
it
own
merit
I
'd
have
given
The
Da
Vinci
Code
a
similar
rate
if
not
for
a
repeat
experi
that
led
to
my
backlashAt
the
begin
of
everi
semest
in
a
bid
to
get
to
know
my
student
better
I
play
a
memori
game
wherein
the
student
provid
me
with
their
favourit
thing
book
food
music
and
some
person
detail
peopl
they
hate
peopl
they
love
thing
they
are
proud
of
then
I
connect
someth
about
them
someth
that
stand
out
for
me
with
their
name
It
is
a
good
start
in
get
to
know
the
student
but
it
ha
also
led
to
my
hatr
for
Dan
Brown
's
The
Da
Vinci
CodeA
good
half
of
the
student
that
enter
my
cours
declar
that
they
do
n't
have
favourit
book
andor
they
've
onli
ever
read
three
book
in
their
live
two
involuntari
both
assign
by
an
English
teacher
and
alway
seem
to
includ
To
Kill
a
Mockingbird
and
one
voluntari
The
Da
Vinci
Code
What
piss
me
off
most
is
that
even
if
these
peopl
like
The
Da
Vinci
Code
Brown
's
novel
did
n't
spur
them
on
to
read
more
They
read
the
The
Da
Vinci
Code
enjoy
it
or
did
n't
then
went
back
to
their
read
apathi
Moreov
if
I
could
convinc
peopl
to
read
one
book
voluntarili
one
book
for
their
pleasur
it
would
not
be
ANi
cheesi

It
's

They
may

but
they
're
not
go
to
choos

as
their
alcohol
of
choic

And
for
that
reason
I
hate
The
Da

Code
It
is
the
cheap
wine
that
keep
peopl
away
from
the
joy
of
good
wine
and
while
I
admit
that
it
is
the
