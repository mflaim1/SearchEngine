He
went
on
to
say
It
had
all
thi
crazi
stuff
in
it
As
part
of
a
primer
when
he
hand

to
me
he
said
Youv
got
to
think
of
A
Tale
of
Two
Citi
which
of
cours
youv

I
said
Absolut
I
read
the
script
and
wa
a
littl
baffl
by
a
few
thing
and
realiz
that
Id
never
read
A
Tale
of
Two
Citi
It
wa
just
one
of
those
thing
that
I
thought
I
had
done
Then
I
got
it
read
it
and
absolut
love
it
and
got
complet
what
he
wa
talk
about
When
I
did
my
draft
on
the
script
it
wa
all
about
A
Tale
of
Two
Citi
The
class
warfar
in

comment
how
their
movi

socioeconom
revolut
plot
year
befor
the
Occupi
movement
Chri
and
David

start
develop
the
stori

right
after

came
out
he
say
Befor

Befor
Occupi

Rather

All
of
these

have
threaten
to

it
on
itself
None

them
have
actual
achiev
that
until
thi
film
A
Tale
of

Citi
wa
to
me
one
of
the
most
harrow
portrait
of
a
relat
recogniz
civil
that
complet
fold
to
piec
with
the
terror
in
